                [en]
            
            âThis article examines the gendered design of Amazon Alexaâs voice-driven
               capabilities, or, âskills,â in order to better understand how Alexa, as an AI
               assistant, mirrors traditionally feminized labour and sociocultural expectations.
               While Alexaâs code is closed source â meaning that the code is not available to be
               viewed, copied, or edited â certain features of the code architecture may be
               identified through methods akin to reverse engineering and black box testing. This
               article will examine what is available of Alexaâs code â the official software
               developer console through the Alexa Skills Kit, code samples and snippets of official
               Amazon-developed skills on Github, and the code of an unofficial, third-party
               user-developed skill on Github â in order to demonstrate that Alexa is designed to be
               female presenting, and that, as a consequence, expectations of gendered labour and
               behaviour have been built into the code and user experiences of various Alexa skills.
               In doing so, this article offers methods in critical code studies toward analyzing
               code to which we do not have access. It also provides a better understanding of the
               inherently gendered design of AI that is designated for care, assistance, and menial
               labour, outlining ways in which these design choices may affect and influence user
               behaviours.

					All","Abstract
                [en]
				
				In late fall 1965, John Kemeny wrote a 239-line BASIC program called
					FTBALL***. Along with his colleague Thomas Kurtz and a few work-study
					students at Dartmouth College, Kemeny had developed the BASIC programming
					language and Dartmouth Time-Sharing System (DTSS). BASIC and DTSS
					represented perhaps the earliest successful attempt at âcomputer
						programming for all,â combining English-language vocabulary, simple
					yet robust instructions, and near-realtime access to a mainframe computer.
					This article takes a closer look at FTBALL as a crucial program in the
					history of âprogramming for allâ while gesturing to the tension
					between a conception of âallâ and FTBALLâs context in an elite,
					all-male college in the mid-1960s. I put FTBALL in a historical, cultural,
					gendered context of âprogramming for allâ as well as the historical
					context of programming language development, timesharing technology, and
					the hardware and financial arrangements necessary to support this kind of
					playful, interactive program in 1965. I begin with a short history of
					BASICâs early development, compare FTBALL with other early games and sports
					games, then move into the hardware and technical details that enabled the
					code before finally reading FTBALLâs code in detail. Using methods from
					critical code studies (Marino 2020), I point to specific innovations of
					BASIC at the time and outline the program flow of FTBALL. This history and
					code reading of BASIC FTBALL provides something of interest to computing
					historians, critical code studies practitioners, and games scholars and
					aficionados.

            A code-critical close reading of two related works by Daniel C. Howe. The artist's
                  Automatype is an installation that visualizes and
               sonifies minimal-distance paths between English words and thus explores a possibility
               space that is relatively familiar to western readers, not only readers of English but
               also readers of any language which uses Latin letters to compose the orthographic
               word-level elements of its writing system . In Radical of
               the Vertical Heart å¿ (RotVH) Howe engages with
               commensurate explorations in certain possibility spaces of the Chinese writing system
               and of the languageâs lexicon. Translinguistically these spaces and, as it were,
               orthographic architectures, are structured in radically different ways. A comparative
               close reading of the two works will bring us into productive discursive relationship
               not only with distinct and code-critically significant programming strategies, but
               also with under-appreciated comparative linguistic concepts having implications for
               the theory of writing systems, of text, and of language as such. Throughout,
               questions concerning the aestheticization of this kind of computational exploration
               and visualization may also be addressed. His website is programmatology.com.

                [en]
				Lillian-Yvonne Bertram's 2019 book of poetry is titled Travesty Generator in reference to Hugh Kenner and Joseph
					O'Rourke's Pascal program to âfabricate
						pseudo-textâ by producing text such that each n-length string
					of characters in the output occurs at the same frequency as in the source
					text. Whereas for Kenner and O'Rourke, labeling their work a
						âtravestyâ is a hyperbolic tease or a literary
					burlesque, for Bertram, the travesty is the political reality of racism in
					America. For each of the works Travesty
						Generator, Bertram uses the generators of computer poetry to
					critique, resist, and replace narratives of oppression and to make explicit
					and specific what is elsewhere algorithmically insidious and
					ambivalent.

				In âCounternarrativesâ, Bertram presents
					sentences, fragments, and ellipses that begin ambiguously but gradually
					resolve point clearly to the moment of Trayvon Martin's killing. The poem
					that opens the book, âthree_last_wordsâ, is at a
					functional level a near-echo of the program in Nick Montfort's âI AM THAT I AMâ, which is itself a version or
					adaptation of Brion Gysin's permutation poem of the same title. But
					Bertramâs poem has one important functional difference in that Bertram's
					version retains and concatenates the entire working result. With this
					modification, the memory required to produce all permutations of the
					phrase, âI canât breatheâ, is sufficiently
					greater than the storage available most computers, so the poem will end in
					a crashed runtime or a frozen computer--metaphorically reenacting and
					memorializing Eric Garnerâs death. Lillian-Yvonne Bertram's Travesty Generator is a challenging, haunting,
					and important achievement of computational literature, and in this essay, I
					expand my reading of this book to dig more broadly and deeply into how
					specific poems work to better appreciate the collection's contribution to
					the field of digital poetry.

            In Prismatikâs Scarlet Portrait Parlor (2020) poetry and

               Parlorâs brevity, simplicity of construction, and immediate recognizability
               as a work of literature (a sonnet) that is also executable source code producing a
               work of electronic literature, has the potential to intrigue students and textual
               scholars unfamiliar with and perhaps resistant to Critical Code Studies (CCS). A
               study of Prismatikâs work also has the potential to refine some simplistic judgements

            The premise of this article is that a basic understanding of the composition and
               functioning of large language models is critically urgent. To that end, we extract a
               representational map of OpenAIâs GPT-2 with what we articulate as two classes of deep
               learning code, that which pertains to the model and that which underwrites
               applications built around the model. We then verify this map through case studies of
               two popular GPT-2 applications: the text adventure game, AI
                  Dungeon, and the language art project, This Word Does
                  Not Exist. Such an exercise allows us to test the potential of Critical
               Code Studies when the object of study is deep learning code and to demonstrate the
               validity of code as an analytical focus for researchers in the subfields of Critical
               Artificial Intelligence and Critical Machine Learning Studies. More broadly, however,
               our work draws attention to the means by which ordinary users might interact with,
               and even direct, the behavior of deep learning systems, and by extension works toward
               demystifying some of the auratic mystery of âAI.â What is at stake is the
               possibility of achieving an informed sociotechnical consensus about the responsible
               applications of large language models, as well as a more expansive sense of their
               creative capabilities â indeed, understanding how and where engagement occurs allows
               all of us to become more active participants in the development of machine learning

            The ubiquity of digital technologies in citizenâs lives marks a major qualitative
               shift where automated decisions taken by algorithms deeply affect the lived
               experience of ordinary people. But this is not just an action-oriented change as
               computational systems can also introduce epistemological transformations in the
               constitution of concepts and ideas. However, a lack of public understanding of how
               algorithms work also makes them a source of distrust, especially concerning the way
               in which they can be used to create frames or channels for social and individual
               behaviour. This public concern has been magnified by election hacking, social media
               disinformation, data extractivism, and a sense that Silicon Valley companies are out
               of control. The wide adoption of algorithms into so many aspects of peoplesâ lives,
               often without public debate, has meant that increasingly algorithms are seen as
               mysterious and opaque, when they are not seen as inequitable or biased. Up until
               recently it has been difficult to challenge algorithms or to question their
               functioning, especially with wide acceptance that softwareâs inner workings were
               incomprehensible, proprietary or secret (cf. open source). Asking why an algorithm
               did what it did often was not thought particularly interesting outside of a strictly
               programming context. This meant that there has been a widening explanatory gap in
               relation to understanding algorithms and their effect on peoplesâ lived experiences.
               This paper argues that Critical Code Studies offers a novel field for developing
               theoretical and code-epistemological practices to reflect on the explanatory deficit
               in modern societies from a reliance on information technologies. The challenge of new
               forms of social obscurity from the implementation of technical systems is heightened
               by the example of machine learning systems that have emerged in the past decade. A
               key methodological contribution of this paper is to show how concept formation, in
               this case of the notion of âtoxicity,â can be traced through key categories and
               classifications deployed in code structures (e.g. modularity and layering software)
               but also how these classifications can appear more stable than they actually are by
               the tendency of software layers to obscure even as they reveal. How a concept such as
                  âtoxicityâ can be constituted through code and discourse and then used
               unproblematically is revealing in relation to both its technical deployment but also
               for a possible computational sociology of knowledge. By developing a broadened notion
               of explainability, this paper argues that critical code studies can make important
               theoretical, code-epistemological and methodological contributions to digital
               humanities, computer science and related disciplines.

            Critical Code Studies often relies on the textual representation of code in order to
               derive extra-textual significance, with less focus on how code performs and in what
               contexts. In this paper we analyze three case studies in which a literal reading of
               each programâs code is effectively nonsense. In their performance, however, the
               programs generate meaning. To discern this meaning, we use the framework of
               nonmaterial performance (NMP), which is based on four tenets: code abstracts, code
               performs, code acts within a network, and code is vibrant. We begin with what is to
               our knowledge the oldest example of nonsense code: a program (now lost) from the
               1950s that caused a Univac 1 computer to hum âHappy
                  Birthdayâ. Second, we critique Firestarter, a processor stress test from
               the Technical University of Dresden. Finally, we analyze one of the family of
               processor power side-channel attacks known collectively as Platypus. In each case,
               the text of the code is a wholly unreliable guide to its extra-textual significance.
               This paper builds on work in Critical Code Studies by bringing in methodologies from
               actor-network theory and political science, examining code from a performance-studies
               perspective and with expertise from computer science. Code can certainly be read as
               literature, but ultimately it is text written to be performed. Imagining and
               observing the performance forces the critic to engage with the code in its own
               network. The three examples we have chosen to critique here are outliers---very
               little code in the world is purposed to manipulate the physical machine. Nonsense
               shows us the opportunity that nonmaterial performance creates: to decenter text from
               privileged position and to recenter code as a performance.

            Esoteric programming languages (esolangs) break from the norms of language design by
               explicitly refusing practicality and clarity. While some go even further and make
               code impossible to write (e.g. Unnecessary), others (e.g. Malboge) retains the
               ability to express functional and reliable code, despite the seeming disorder of the
               language. To understand the conversation these languages are having, we must look at
               how they challenge or re-affirm wider ideas in programming culture and in how
               computer science is taught: specifically the sometimes-contradictory aesthetics of

                How can we know what our computational infrastructures are doing to us? More to
                    the point, how can we have any confidence that their effects on our minds are
                    positive rather than negative? Certainly, it is the case that digital
                    infrastructures combined with spatial and temporal organisation create forms of
                    digitally-enabled structures that serve to change the cognitive capacity of
                    humans. How then to assess these new digital infrastructures and machine
                    learning systems? One of the most difficult tasks facing the critical theorist
                    today is understanding the delegation and prescription of agency in digital
                    infrastructures. These are capital intensive systems and hence tend to be
                    developed by corporations or governments in order to combine multiple systems
                    into a single unity. The systems they build are often difficult if not
                    impossible to understand and require the public to trust but not to be able to
                    verify the system decisions. In contrast, recent moves to assuage worries over
                    the opaque and threatening potential of computation have been partially
                    addressed through a new legal right to challenge algorithms and their decisions.
                    This requirement, termed âexplainability,â I suggest might contribute to
                    tool criticism within digital humanities for investigating and potentially
                    challenging these assemblages and creating a potential for democratic
                    contestation.

                This paper is a case-driven contribution to the discussion on the method-theory
                    relationship in practices within the field ofÂ Computational Literary
                        StudiesÂ (CLS). Progress in this field dedicated to the computational
                    analysis of literary texts has long revolved around the new, digital tools:
                    tools, as computational devices for analysis, have had here a comparatively
                    strong status as research entities of their own, while their ontological status
                    has remained unclear to the day. As a rule, they have widely been imported from
                    the fields of data science and NLP, while less often being hand-tailored to
                    specific tasks within interdisciplinary settings. Although studies within CLS
                    are evolving to both a higher degree of specialization in method (going beyond
                    the limitations of out-of-the-box tools) and a stronger theoretical modeling,
                    the technological dimension remains a defining factor. An unreflective adoption
                    of technology in the shape of tools can compromise the plausibility and the
                    reproducibility of the results produced using these tools.Â 
                Our paper presents a multi-faceted intervention to the discussion around tools,
                    methods, and the research questions that are answered with them. It presents
                    research perspectives first conceived at the ADHO SIG-DLS workshop Anatomy of tools: A closer look at textual DH
                        methodologies that took place in Utrecht in July 2019. At that
                    event, the authors discussed selected case studies to address tool criticism
                    from several angles. Our goal was to leverage a tool-critical perspective, in
                    order to âtake stock, reflect upon and critically comment
                        upon our own practicesâ within CLS. Â 
                We identifiedÂ TextomÃ©trie, Stylometry, and
                        Semantic Text MiningÂ as three central types of hands-on CLS.
                    For each of these sub-fields, we asked:Â What are our tools and
                        methods-in-use? What are the implications of using a tool-oriented
                        perspective as opposed to a methodology-oriented one? How do either relate
                        to research questions and theory? These questions were explored by
                    case-studies on an exemplary basis.
                 The unifying perspective of this paper is an applied tool criticismÂ â a critical
                    inquiry leveraged towards crucial dimensions of CLS practices. Here we
                    re-compose the original oral papers and add entirely new sections to it, to
                    create a useful overview of the issue through a combination of perspectives.
                    While we elaborated the thematic connections between the individual case
                    studies, we hope the interactive spirit of an exemplary exchange remains
                    palpable: individual research perspectives shape the case studies reported
                        forÂ TextomÃ©trie, Stylometry and Semantic
                        Text Mining, are complemented by further studies showcasing
                    CLS-specific perspectives
                        onÂ replicabilityÂ andÂ domain-specific research, and
                    a short section discussing aÂ tool inventoryÂ as a practical,
                    community-based incarnation ofÂ tool criticism.Â 
                The article reflects thus a rich array of perspectives on tool
                        criticism, including the complementary perspective of tool
                        defense â arguing that we need tools and methods as a basic common
                    ground on how to carry out fundamental operations of analysis and interpretation
                    within a community.

                Sound studies in general, and voice studies in particular, present particular
                    challenges for digital humanities scholarship. The software tools available to
                    digital humanists who want to study performative speech are less familiar and
                    less developed for our uses, and the user base is also much smaller than for
                    text mining or network analysis. This article provides a critical narrative of

                This article surveys the ways in which issues of race and gender bias emerge in
                    projects involving the use of predictive analytics, big data and artificial
                    intelligence (AI). It analyses some of the reasons biased results occur and
                    argues for the importance of open documentation and explainability in combatting
                    these inequities. Digital humanities can make a significant contribution in
                    addressing these issues. This article was written in late 2020, and discussion
                    and public debate about AI and bias has moved on enormously since the article
                    was completed. Nevertheless, the fundamental proposition of this article has
                    become even more important and pressing as debates around AI have progressed â
                    namely, that as a result of the development of big data and AI, it is vital to
                    foster critical and socially aware approaches to the construction and analysis
                    of data. The greatest threat to humanity from AI comes not from autonomous
                    killer robots but rather from the social dislocation and injustices caused by an
                    overreliance on poorly designed and badly documented commercial black boxes to
                    administer everything from health care to public order and crime.

                    section, a possible use of SA in narratology and reader response studies is
                    discussed, highlighting the gaps between literary theories and computational

                Thanks to easy-to-use data analysis tools and digital infrastructures, even those
                    humanities scholars who lack programming skills can work with large-scale
                    empirical datasets in order to disclose patterns and correlations within them.
                    Although empirical research trends have existed throughout the history of the
                    humanities , these recently emergent possibilities have
                    revived an empiricist attitude among humanities scholars schooled in more
                    critical and interpretive traditions. Replying to calls for a
                        critical digital humanities 
                    , this paper explores âtool
                        criticismâ
                     â a critical attitude required of digital humanities
                    scholars when working with computational tools and digital infrastructures.
                    First, it explores tool criticism as a response to instrumentalism in the
                    digital humanities and proposes it to be part of what a critical digital
                    humanities does. Second, it analyses tool criticism as practice, in practice.
                    Concretely, it discusses two critical makingâinspired workshops in which
                    participants explored the affordances of digital tools and infrastructures and
                    their underlying assumptions and values. The first workshop focused on âgames-as-toolsâ
                    . Participants in the workshop engaged with the
                    constraints, material and mechanical, of a card game by making modifications to
                    it. In the second workshop, drawing on the concept of âdigital infrapunctureâ
                    , participants examined digital infrastructure in
                    terms of capacity and care. After first identifying âhurtâ in a chat
                    environment, they then designed bots to intervene in that hurt and offer
                    relief.

            Proverbs are an essential component of language and culture, and though much attention
               has been paid to their history and currency, there has been comparatively little
               quantitative work on changes in the frequency with which they are used over time. With
               wider availability of large corpora reflecting many diverse genres of documents, it is
               now possible to take a broad and dynamic view of the importance of the proverb. Here, we
               measure temporal changes in the relevance of proverbs within four corpora, differing in
               kind, scale, and time frame: Millions of books over centuries; thousands of books over
               centuries; millions of news articles over twenty years; and billions of tweets over a
               decade. While similar methodologies abound lately, they have not yet been performed
               using comprehensive phraseological lexica (here, The Dictionary of
                  American Proverbs). We show that beyond simple partitioning of texts into words,
               searches for culturally significant phrases can yield distinct insights from the same
               corpora. Comparative analysis between four commonly used corpora show that each reveals
               its own relationship to the phenomena being studied. We also find that the frequency
               with which proverbs appear in texts follows a similar distribution to that of individual
               words.

            This article demonstrates the value of âscalable readingâ of historical travel
               guides, combining traditional close reading with computer-assisted distant reading.
               Aiming to scrutinize the persistence of older tourist attractions under communism, we
               analyse guidebooks intended for similar audiences but produced under different
               political regimes. More specifically, we compare three travel guides to the same
               geographical area produced between 1905 and 1959: one to communist cold war
               Czechoslovakia, one to democratic interwar Czechoslovakia, and one to the
               Habsburg-era Czech lands and Slovakia. We analyse the geographic distribution of
               attractions by geolocating the guidebook toponyms and visualizing them with
               Geographic Information Systems (GIS). This distant reading is complemented with a
               hermeneutic analysis grounded in a close reading of the guidebook text. The
               combination of these approaches documents the similarities in the symbolic
               representation of the countryâs attractions across political caesuras and provides a
               methodological template for future explorations of travel guides with historical
               GIS.

            A novel, rule-based, automatic framework for identifying rhetorical elements in
               classical Arabic poetry is described. Since rule-based approaches have well-known
               limitations, it is proposed as an interim solution until a sufficient quantity of
               annotated text has been amassed with which to train a machine-learning algorithm. The
               manual process of identifying rhetorical features in classical Arabic poetry is both
               time-consuming and requires high-level expertise in Arabic literature. Hence, an
               automatic recognition system will solve this challenge. Automatic identification is,
               however, challenging, mainly because there is no existing annotated corpus with which
               to train a machine-learning-based classifier. The framework proposed here combines
               natural language-processing techniques with a rule-based reasoning approach, and will

            Southern Italian digital humanist Domenico Fiormonte has argued that âDH isâ¦a discipline and academic discourse dominated materially by an
                  Anglo-American Ã¨lite and intellectually by a mono-cultural viewâ
                and has repeatedly called for a digital
               humanities that âimprove[s] and cultivate[s] the marginsâ¦[giving]
                  more attention [to] variegated cultural and and linguistic cultural
                  diversityâ
               . Similarly, Crystal Hall points out that
               both the Digital Humanities and Italian Studies âhave struggled
                  with inclusivity and the representation for traditionally marginalized
                  voicesâ¦[though] both fields offer tools and materials of study that can assist in
                  [a] transformationâ
               . This article takes up the work of these
               scholars in its investigation of the Neapolitan language on YouTube. According to
               UNESCO, the Neapolitan language is a vulnerable language because the number of
               speakers has been decreasing steadily in Southern Italy, forecasting the eventual
               extinction of the Southern Italian language. UNESCOâs categorization of Neapolitan as
                  âvulnerableâ is problematic because it only accounts for speakers in Southern
               Italy and not in the Italian diaspora, which involves a physical relocation of
               Neapolitans to other parts of the world such as Australia and the United States. It
               is also problematic because it indicates that Italians either in Italy or in the
               diaspora may no longer want to speak Neapolitan. A Neapolitan digital diaspora,
               unaccounted for in UNESCO statistics, also exists on social media, which may include
               Neapolitans in Italy and abroad but also may include first-generation Italians,
               heritage-language speakers, and other-culture people fluent or familiar with the
               language. In this article, I explore how usages of Neapolitan-Italian language on
               YouTube might counter the linguistic and cultural subordination of Neapolitans.

            The date of artifacts is an important factor for scholars to get a further understanding of culture and society of the past. However, many
               artifacts are damaged over time, and we can often only get fragments of

				In recent decades, university research has become bound up in the expectation of innovation, often at the expense of sustainability. As a guiding principle, innovation has shaped the goals of universities and funders; the recent turn to sustainability, signaled by the rise of data management plans and data deposit requirements, may indicate a welcome discursive shift. This article explores the interplay of knowledge creation and mentorship in the development of digital humanities research projects, with the aim of articulating how to resolve the artificial tension between innovation and sustainability. While often framed in opposition to each other, or used in a neoliberal framework to force researchers to do more with fewer resources, innovation and sustainability can, this article argues, be dual goals in the development of lasting digital humanities scholarship, with a focus on XML serializationsâ role in this scholarly ecosystem.

            The internet has vastly expanded access to Shakespeare resources, as well as the
               range of materials included in the Shakespeare canon. Online Shakespeare resources
               often focus on making Shakespeare more accessible to educators, students, and general
               audiences. Accessibility for people with disabilities, however, is not often
               mentioned. This article argues for making Shakespeare resources radically accessible
               and inclusive by incorporating both Universal Design approaches and Disability
               Studies perspectives. This dual approach emphasizes the importance of accessible
               technologies and the necessity of incorporating Disability Studies theories and
               methods, including contributions of Deaf and disabled artists and scholars and
               critical analyses of cultural representations of disability. While the
               overrepresentation of Shakespeare in digital space is problematic, the massive scope
               of Shakespeareâs online presence provides opportunities for radically transforming,
               or cripping, the digital canon. Cripping the digital Shakespeare canon involves
               centering accessibility, incorporating anti-ableist content, and promoting new
               methods of engaging with Shakespeare and digital spaces. Due to Shakespeareâs
               outsized presence, cripping the digital Shakespeare canon provides a significant
               avenue for advancing the accessibility and inclusivity of digital resources
               generally.

            history, religion, biblical studies and more, Tiresias is multilingual, contains
            about 140,000 subject tags and about 16.4 million references to ancient primary

                [en]
            Analysis of historical periodicals through digital tools is still a predominantly text-based field. This paper seeks to expand the toolbox of researchers of these sources, and addresses the observed capability gap, by proposing a new technique for the discovery of appearance patterns in historical newspaper collections. It calls this technique Bleedmapping after the effect it produces, making it seem as if a multitude of pages have âbled throughâ each other and showing the greatest concentration of articles matching a chosen search parameter visually in an intuitive and easy to interpret manner. This approach greatly extends the toolbox of scholars by providing them a method to explore the metatextual and spatial context of the texts they study. Using a case study on Reynolds' Newspaper this article shows the value of Bleedmapping when used alongside a text-based LDA analysis, showing the prevalence of the British Empire in the paper's âNotices to Correspondentsâ.

            Cleaning and provisional restoration treatments on The
                  Crucifixion (1425) revealed that the visible azurite layer obscures an
               originally golden background. This leads to the question of whether or not the
               azurite should be removed as it is not original, or should be kept as part of the
               panelâs history. To overcome this dilemma, this paper presents a methodological
               solution of approaching this problem by combining the knowledge of art historians,
               restorers and by integrating modern 3D technologies before, during, and after the
               restoration. By creating a modifiable digital model, a virtual restoration can
               potentially attribute to analyzing and visualizing optical changes due to restoration
               treatments. Additionally, multiple 3D-printed facsimiles physicalize these
               adaptations. A facsimileâs value is demonstrated by analyzing the diversity of
               meanings an artwork can have in terms of authenticity whilst respecting the artwork's

            Historical materials are an indispensable resource for many scholarly workflows in
               the Digital Humanities. These workflows can benefit from the application of natural
               language processing (NLP) pipelines that offer support for tokenization, tagging,
               lemmatization, and dependency parsing. However, the application of these tools is not
               trivial as âoff-the-shelf,â or pre-trained, tools are prone to error when given
               historical text as input and training data development can be expensive to carry out
               in terms of time and expertise needed. This paper introduces a rule-based workflow
               that can produce improved annotations encoded in Universal Dependencies (UD) targeted
               for modern historical Japanese corpora using only a pre-trained UD tool as a starting
               point. The proposed workflow reduces the amount of manual review time needed for
               training data development and brings improvements over pre-trained tools on a word
               segmentation task. Moreover, the workflow has the potential to pave the path toward
               adapting advanced NLP technologies to historical corpora under study.

				Academic conferences are considered central to the dissemination of research
					and play a key role in the prestige systems of academia. And yet the
					organization of these, and the power systems they maintain, have been
					little discussed. What is a conference supposed to achieve? Who and what is
					it for? The annual Alliance of Digital Humanities Organization (ADHO)âs
					Digital Humanities conference is a central occasion in the digital
					humanities academic calendar, and, as an international, interdisciplinary,
					regular, long-standing, large-scale event, it provides an ideal locus to
					consider various aspects of contemporary academic conference organization,
					and how this impacts the shape and definition of a scholarly field.
					Examining this annual event allows us to clarify ADHOâs policies and
					procedures to consider how they frame the digital humanities at large. This
					paper approaches the annual Digital Humanities conference via a
					Reflection-in-Action and Reflection-on-Action approach encompassing the
					experiences of various people formally involved in organizing the
					conference over the past decade. Considering the last seven years of the
					conference as well as its broader history, we argue that conferences are
					central mechanisms for agenda setting and fostering a community of digital
					humanities practitioners. Through analyses of the selection of Program
					Committees, the choosing of conference themes, the preparation of calls for
					papers, the peer review process, and the selection of keynotes, we contend
					that existing structures and processes inadequately address concerns around
					representation, diversity, multilingualism, and labor. Our recommendations,
					including aligning the conference budget with its priorities, fostering
					fair labor practices, and creating accountability structures will be useful
					to those organizing future Digital Humanities events, and conference
					organizers throughout academia interested in making academic conferences
					more inclusive, welcoming environments that encourage a plurality of voices
					to fully partake in academic discourse.

               Teaching DH from the inside out â to computer scientists rather than humanists â has
               allowed us to see more clearly neglected areas of DH pedagogy that are in need of
               greater attention. Our experiences have shown us that if DH is to thrive as a field
               beyond traditional humanities departments in the U.S. and Europe, we need to better
               articulate and theorize the connections between humanities and computer scientific
               epistemologies. When teaching non-humanities students, in particular, we have found
               it necessary to pay more attention to humanities research methods and projects
               grounded in humanities research questions. In developing a curriculum that reflects
               our Singaporean context too, we have found that diversity in global DH should go
               beyond simply broadening DHâs cultural scope but must involve a more open and global
               engagement with computational, cultural research that may not identify disciplinarily
               as DH.

					Introducing Salience Differentiated Stability","Abstract
                [en]
				
				In digital studies of the use of words in intellectual history, meaning is
					measured based on the idea of Firth that a word can be characterized by the
					company it keeps. The words that are literally close to it in the texts in
					which it is written should tell us something about what the word means. In
					practice, we will look at meaning being measured by a method called Pointwise Mutual Information or PMI for short.
					However, even granting that we use PMI, this description is still quite
					vague and allows for multiple different ways to interpret 'the company a
					word keeps' in the practice of coding an actual algorithm to discern this
					company. In this paper we will look specifically at the choice to 1. use
					all words close to another or 2. use merely the ones that are most
					disproportionately present. Using work from contemporary philosophers of
					language Mark Wilson and Sally Haslanger, we argue that both capture an
					aspect of meaning, 2 capturing the most salient way to understand a word,
					and 1 capturing the subtle, not so salient, but nonetheless important ways
					in which words are used overall. Then we will look to measure the overall
					stability in word meaning, the degree to which it is used similarly in
					different texts within a corpus. Having characterized PMI, salience and
					stability we will introduce Salience Differentiated
						Stability or SDS, a value indicating both the salient and less
					salient stability of a word, which will help identify words that are
					simpler or more shifty than they at first appear. Lastly we will test the
					use of this new value by doing a case study of the salience differentiated
					stability of common terms in early modern physics text books.

				This article focuses on the international news flow regarding the execution of
					Maximilian, the Emperor of Mexico. The execution occurred in June 1867, but it
					received global attention only at the beginning of July when the news started to
					spread over the borders, via telegraph, and rapidly through the network of

					execution and the regional differences in these sentiments on an empirical
					level. On a methodological level, the article investigates the strategies to
					analyze sentiments via newspaper corpora in a multilingual research setting. The
					study is based on optically recognized historical newspapers in three languages
					(German, Spanish and English), and four regions (Austria, Germany, Mexico, and
					the United States). Our analysis shows content variations in the corpora, mainly
					that news was framed differently in each studied region, indicating that the
					local perception of the event and political interests shaped the news. In our
					corpus, the Mexican press âpublished in the middle of a political crisisâ tended
					towards a neutral stance, the Austrian and German papers mainly were negative,
					and the United States showed mixed sentiments on the incident.

            As algorithmic models increasingly assist, judge, and manage human life, a growing

               violence of such powerful applications and demanding a renewed focus on bias, ethics,
               and governance. At the same time elite academic institutions and massive tech firms
               have been adaptively adept at the capture and depoliticizing of its critics [Whittaker 2021]. Calls for a fundamental reckoning with the logics and
               violences of computation have been largely disciplined into niche new industries of
               expertise which Phan, Goldenfein, Mann, and Kuch refer to as âeconomies of

               critical intervention into the residues of Post-Enlightenment thought mapped onto and

               might we look to to recover computational practices that challenge colonial logics of

               proximal possibilities and directs our attention to the quotidian, social, opaque,

            Little is left of the built environment that marked the Greenville-Longtown Black
               Settlement, a once-thriving, free Black agricultural community on the border of
               Randolph County, Indiana, and Darke County, Ohio. The people of Greenville have not
               been forgotten, however, because of the memory-work undertaken by each generation of
               Black women whose power and agency connects their past with their future descendants.
               This article draws on âdescendant archival practicesâ as a method to understand the
               importance of Greenvilleâs Black women in the preservation of rural Black community
               heritage and in the writing of Black womenâs histories in the antebellum Midwest.
               Descendant archival practices connect Black digital humanities practices to the
               Longtown-Greenville descendant community's digitization of artifacts and oral
               histories and supports a community-owned version of their active Facebook group. The
               result, a History Harvest called âRemembering Freedom: Longtown and
                     Greenville History Harvestâ, will facilitate ongoing community
               participation and future history harvests for overlooked, forgotten, and
               long-silenced communities.

               My Day of DH (Digital Humanities) 2020 included an hour long talk with a social
                  media platform about diversity and inclusion on said platform. Following their
                  initial inquiry, I raised concern around the language of âinclusion,â
                  countering that inclusion implies bringing people into an already existing center.
                  I asked if their BIPOC users really wanted to be included or if they wanted to be
                  allowed to exist on the platform without being disproportionately surveilled. My
                  ability to garner the attention of a social media platform and then critique its
                  work is not something I envisioned for myself when I started out in DH.

            This short reflective essay meditates on how/why digital Blackness need not strive to
               recover or repair humanity for Black peoples. It questions the teleological drive for
               building Black digital archives and technologies motivated by representational

               (2007) notion that such folding into the figure of the human â overrepresented by
               Western Man â snuffs polyvalent and polysemic pluralities for Blackness.

            Building on an earlier e-Black studies manifesto from the late aughts, this paper outlines a Black DH, that as a social movement and as a political project challenges without hesitation or apology a still white-dominated field of digital humanities â and is resolute concerning its commitment to racial justice. As Moya Bailey, Kim Gallon, and Jessica Marie Johnson have argued elsewhere, Black DH should be simultaneously experimental, analytical, computational, speculative, and have unique design capabilities as a series of practices and speculative exercises. This paper proposes guidelines or principles to assist this and makes clear that the process of scholarly inquiry with Black knowledge-making, and discovery takes precedent over final product. This praxis is possible if we promote collaborative co-creation models of teaching, research, and service for the humanities in an interdisciplinary framework that centers and helps prioritize Black women and queer voices and perspectives in Black DH work.

            Interdisciplinary collaboration within digital humanities research requires brokering
               and boundary-crossing work. This article maps interdisciplinary exchanges between
               computer scientists, media scholars and information scientists to explicate how
               interdisciplinary brokering affects knowledge and tool production in the digital
               humanities. The analysis of qualitative data collected during a 17 month-long digital
               humanities research pilot - set to collaboratively test a digital Linked Open Data
               (LOD) search tool - provides insights into the exploratory search behaviour of a
               total of 122 (digital) humanities scholars, and how these insights informed brokering
               work within an interdisciplinary research team. The article argues that
               interdisciplinary collaboration first and foremost requires disciplinary recognition
               in order to succeed, and demonstrates how practical, empirical research insights - in
               this case about user research - mobilize interdisciplinary decision-making processes.
               Conclusions indicate in what ways computational tools and collaboration affect
               knowledge production, and suggest that understanding the stakes of digital humanities
               research with digital audio-visual sources requires an integrated perspective
               characterized by both theoretical interdisciplinary discussions and their empirical,
               practical application. The article furthermore concludes that digital humanities
               brokering and boundary work should not only revolve around tool development, but also
               requires self-reflexivity in aligning epistemological chasms between disciplines by
               means of collaborative translation practices.

               society]?â through network visualization methods. This project subverts the typical data
               visualization strategy of working with extant data by encouraging users to produce data,
               demonstrating how data visualization techniques can constitute a way of thinking and
               creating rather than just analyzing and representing. However, this tool and its
               affordances are primarily a case study for a sociological approach to critical design in
               the Digital Humanities: By critically examining the tool itself (as well as the process
               that created it), I am able to pose the broader questions of (1) how does the creation
               of digital tools and projects reflect a theoretical interpretation of the social world
               and its processes, and (2) how can these interpretations constitute the data of
               sociological studies? In resolving these questions, I suggest that critical design can
               be viewed as theory, experiment, and data: designs constitute a social theory, data can
               be experimentally produced within this social theory, and encouraging reflective design
               can turn the social theories of design themselves into data.

            In Auschwitz-Birkenau men and women were detained separately; anecdotal evidence
               suggests that they behaved differently. However, producing evidence based insights
               into victims' behavior is challenging. Perpetrators frequently destroyed camp
               documentations; victims' perspective remains dispersed in thousands of oral history
               interviews with survivors. Listening to, watching, or reading these thousands of
               interviews is not viable, and there is no established computational approach to
               gather systematic evidence from a large number of interviews. In this study, by
               applying methods and concepts of molecular physics, we developed a conceptual
               framework and computational approach to study thousands of human stories and we
               investigated 6628 interviews by survivors of the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp. We
               applied the concept of state space and the Markov State Model to model the ensemble
               of 6628 testimonies. The Markov State Model along with the Transition Path Theory
               allowed us to compare the way women and men remember their time in the camp. We found
               that acts of solidarity and social bonds are the most important topics in their
               testimonies. However, we found that women are much more likely to address these
               topics. We provide systematic evidence that not only were women more likely to recall
               solidarity and social relations in their belated testimonies but they were also more
               likely to perform acts of solidarity and form social bonds in Auschwitz-Birkenau.
               Oral history interviews with Holocaust survivors constitute an important digital
               cultural heritage that documents one of the darkest moments in human history;
               generally, oral history collections are ubiquitous sources of modern history and
               significant assets of libraries and archives. We anticipate that our conceptual and
               computational framework will contribute not only to the understanding of gender
               behavior but also to the exploration of oral history as a cultural heritage, as well
               as to the computational study of narratives. This paper presents novel synergies
               between history, computer science, and physics, and it aims to stimulate further
               collaborations between these fields.

               Boder; the second were conducted by the USC Shoah Foundation Visual History Archive
               in the 1990s. We focus on two salient testimonies from each corpus in order to
               describe the methodology and what the analysis of agency can contribute to the
               writing of âmicrohistoriesâ of the Holocaust. Building on semantic web analyses,
               the methods provide a groundwork for the development of a graph database to search
               testimonies by agency and thereby provide historical insights about what people
               report they did and what was done to them.

          creating such visualizations and show how they can be navigated in ways that produce more
          trustworthy and more useful products. Our recommendations balance tensions between
          qualitative and quantitative and objective and subjective aspects of knowledge mapping.
          They demonstrate the importance of critical practices in the development of knowledge
          maps, illustrate the intertwined nature of analysis and results in such projects, and
          emphasize the constructedness of the resulting visualization. We argue that the only way
          to produce an effective knowledge map is to produce an ethical one, which requires
          attention to the ways trust and accountability can be produced at every step of analysis
          and production. This extends the literature on ethical visualization in digital humanities
          projects by offering a clear example of the utility of a critical approach for a
          traditional, science-oriented knowledge mapping project.

				The difficulty of integrating the data, metadata, and classification schemes
					produced across a wide geographic, historical, and cultural variety of
					institutional sites and practices was a major impetus for the creation of
					Linked Data (LD). The promise was to make diverse sets of data
					interoperable through subscription to an array of standardizations while
					leaving the original data intact. These operational requirements enable
					interoperability at the expense of specificity, and require considerable
					resources for implementation. While LD supports connection and access
					across disparate data sets, it is not focused on the intellectual issues
					that have to do with enabling the correlation and comparison of diverse
					ontologies, or preserving and exploring their epistemic and cultural
					specificity â issues essential to humanistic study. In addition, LD is
					exclusively concerned with linguistic data, and can hence not be applied to
					information that is expressed in graphical form. Contrastingly, the
					Heterochronologies project regards temporality as a concept expressed
					epistemically through various culturally-specific, authoritative
					ontologies, which are instantiated by graphical representations such as
					chronologies and timelines. The project concentrates on extracting
					computationally tractable structured data from historical images so that
					the underlying ontologies may be compared without subsuming them into a
					hegemonic data model. In this sense, the Heterochronologies project is an
					exercise in comparative ontology. 
				In this paper we describe the factors that motivated the project; its various
					epistemological underpinnings, as well as the methodological approach that
					guided its development; the phases of our work; and the contributions that
					emerged from the project. Though currently still in development, its
					culmination is a digital platform â the Time Capsule â that supports
					comparative pedagogy, and in so doing demonstrates both validity and
					relevance of a few fundamental notions: a) structured data can be
					systematically extracted from graphical structures with a logical approach;
					b) comparisons of temporal schemes can be supported by a digital platform
					that considers them as instantiations of ontologies that need not be
					reconciled to a single standard; c) the historical and cultural specificity
					of these ontologies can be exposed and analyzed using digital means.

				This paper uses network theory and network analysis to propose a new approach
					to analyzing cross-dressing in Shakespearean drama, specifically the key
					questions driving much of the scholarship on that topic in recent decades:
					What kind of disruption to the social order did cross-dressing represent in
					Early Modern England, and what did it mean to shift that disruption from
					the street to the stage? We know that the laws and customs of the age
					emphasized clothing that matched the outward appearances of people to their
					places in the social order. Network analysis allows us to analyze how
					characters become gendered through a non-linear, non-hierarchical lattice
					of social relationships. As the characters interact and social
					relationships change, the individualâs gendered subjectivity also
					transforms. We find that cross-dressing protagonists propel themselves from
					isolated social worlds into a complex web of relationships through
					cross-dressing, and that entry into sociability follows predictable
					patterns. By following those patterns, the characters combine roles--the
					broker and the heroine--that are normally separate in Shakespearean comic
					plots, creating a hybrid type that becomes visible through network
					analysis.

            Originally devised as an insult by Richard Wollheim, the term âminimalismâ
               described a 1960s movement that foregrounded the relationship between an art object and
               its museum viewer. Today, minimalism is the guiding ethos for a surprising variety of
               pop cultural phenomena, from belongings that spark joy to
               contemplative practice that increases mindfulness. This article first takes a broader
               view of minimalism to register several problematic echoes of minimal computing among
               digital detoxers and disaster survivalists in intensities ranging from Luddism to
               asceticism. Attention needs to be given to these echoes, especially when valorizing DIY
               infrastructures built out of necessity by Indigenous, poor, or coastal communitiesÂ and
               out of privilege by doomsday preppers. Second, this article asks what becomes of minimal
               computing now that we have seen the vital importance of maximal connection during the
               COVID-19 pandemic. Do arguments for minimalism still hold in a socially-distant,
               unevenly-connected world? I argue that it will be important to reframe the digital
               minimalist conversations of the 2010s for the demands of digital equity in the 2020s.
               Going forward, we should ask: which of these competing claims to minimalism â as a form
               of attention, mindfulness, and agency â are compatible with maximal connection, with
               maximal choice, with maximal investment in communities and infrastructures? And when we
               hold up minimalism as a virtue, is that virtue a property of particular tools or
               specific techniques for using them? Finally, this article profiles the ways that
               academic conversations on minimal computing have independently taken root outside
               universities through grassroots organizing and activism under the banner of community
               technology. I close by suggesting ways that minimal computing can be led by community
               input, while also playing a role in public scholarship and community partnerships that
               extend existing academic research.

            The process of making digital objects available and discoverable demands a great deal
               of labor, from digitization, to creating metadata, to preservation, to importing it
               into a digital asset management system, and finally to presenting it. We begin this
               essay with a case study of one such system, called âVault,â in the University of
               Victoria Libraries, and the work required to migrate from a Software as a Service
               (SAAS) model (called ContentDM) to a free and open-source software (FOSS) model (a
               customized instance of Samvera).

            Vault illustrates what we call âminimal computing from the labor
                  perspective,â which seeks to reduce the opacity of software through
                  âlow-techâ practices such as pseudocode, thereby reducing the alienation of
               practitioners from their projects. Drawing from feminist ecological work on
               capitalism, affective labor, and care, we advocate for the âdegrowthâ of digital
               projects by resisting tendencies to reinvest surplus labor and value into increased
               productivity. Instead, degrowth as minimal computing prompts practitioners to
               articulate a projectâs needs and desires; what work is required and from whom; and
               how or whether to sustain this labor for the future.

            This paper focuses on the practical realities of implementing the most common minimal computing methods for web development. It addresses the amount of technically-oriented detail-work required to configure the complex set of components that underpin widely-used platforms for static site generation. When going âminimalâ requires a great deal of technical labor, what implications does that have for its adoption by scholars without ongoing technical support, or the money or connections to delegate that work? What is the added emotional labor for technical collaborators who are only allowed to âconsultâ with scholars, when they attempt to coach scholars through implementing a minimal computing site on their own? What opportunities are lost when a web development methodology cannot reasonably be taught in a hands-on way in a short workshop? After describing these challenges, this paper proposes that an infrastructural intervention â encompassing everything from writing better documentation, tutorials, and templates, to developing interfaces that mediate between users and technical complexity â is necessary to realize the potential of minimal computing as a framework for sustainable websites.

            Drawing on software studies, data feminism, digital rhetoric studies, information
               science, and the history of computing, this paper foregrounds Markdown as a cultural
               object to analyze the social, cultural, and political pressures surrounding the
               digital humanities. Rather than beginning with contemporary discourse, it draws
               parallels between Markdown and Donald Knuth's TeX.Â From the 1970s to 1990s, academic
               researchers used TeX to construct plain-text scholarship in mathematics and the hard
               sciences to enhance typography. Most academics saw these concerns as holding marginal
               importance and quickly abandoned the approach for WYSIWYG word processors. Drawing on
               queer theorist Michael Warner, I argue that the community surrounding TeX responded
               reactionarily to these transformations by forming a counterpublic constituted through a
               circulation of texts bemoaning word processors . This
               counterpublic persisted well into the 2000s but only made headway amongst niche
               users.
            This plain-text focused counterpublic mutated in response to the neoliberalization of
               higher ed. Rather than viewing plain-text as âsustainable
                  scholarship,â academic lifehacking and minimal computingÂ embraced what
               David Golumbia calls âcomputationalism,â an ideological construct postulating social,
               political, economic, and cultural ills as cybernetic systems to be optimized â or
                  âhacked.â Minimal computingâs fetishization and casting of
               plain-text as transformative mirrors similar discourses amongst older lifehacking
               enthusiasts. Although plain-text scholarship is not representative of minimal
               computing as a totality, minimal computing's emphasisÂ on workflows leads to few of
               the supposed benefits advocates profess, and in many cases, worsens inequalities.

            At 33TB of data in its main collection, the highly illegal Library Genesis project is
               one of the largest repositories of copyright-violating educational ebooks ever
               created. Established over a decade ago in 2008, the goal of Library Genesis is nothing
               short of a modern Library of Alexandria, albeit without anyoneâs legal sanction. As
               one of its administrators wrote: âwithin decades, generations of
                  people everywhere in the world will grow up with access to the best scientific
                  texts of all time. [...] [T]he quality and accessibility of education to the poor
                  will grow dramatically too. Frankly, I see this as the only way to naturally
                  improve mankind: we need to make all the information available to them at any
                  timeâ
               . Rooted in its homelandâs Russian communist principles and
               particularly the Soviet isolationist copyright policies of the twentieth century,
               Library Genesis is a formidable resource and threat to conventional academic publishers.
            The Library Genesis database had just short of 1.2m records (books) in 2014 . As of January 2020, this capacity has doubled to 2.5m
               books. In this article, I examine the minimal computational design choices taken
               by this maximal-in-intent, illicit archive of epistemological dissent and how such
               decisions have shaped the scalability and growth of the platform. This includes
               Library Genesisâs numerical subdivision of record identifiers into âbucketsâ to work around
               directory file limitations in the GNU/Linux operating system; its use of md5 hashing
               of filenames within directories capped at 1,000 files to avoid future hashing
               collisions while allowing for on-disk integrity checking; and its use of the MySQL
               socket/network server as opposed to SQLite or similar disk-based database.
            Beyond these computational details, though, the theoretical tension that this article
               highlights is the path dependencies that are set in (illegal) computational projects
               that have goals of absolute abundance and maximalist capacity, and the minimalist
               design principles that they must instigate at the outset to ensure a degree of
               scalability. I also query the ways in which the projectâs contested mission
               statements target an economic (geographic) audience demographic with only minimalist
               access to high-capacity computing resources. I finally examine the limits on
               scalability of the distribution of the Library Genesis through its torrent archive
               and other distributed networking technologies such as IPFS, which despite their
               promise of peer-to-peer redundancy fall down on an archive of this size.

               and ethical engagement. While this piece focuses on Makers by Mail, we hope our
               experience can bring attention to the ways in which precarity operates and is
               operationalized by individuals and institutions to reinforce traditional notions of
               power, limiting opportunities for marginalized peoples and groups. We hope that our
               experiences offer insight into the lives of precarious digital humanists, and that
               they continue pushing our field to reconsider when and how we support digital
               scholars and their projects. There are many ways to push against precarity in digital
               humanities â providing better contracts, paying higher wages, offering funding
               opportunities, developing mentorship networks, giving appropriate credit, supporting
               career growth, and promoting structural change. Any of the above can help shift our
               work away from precarity and toward praxis â working with and supporting communities.
               While minimal computing methodologies can help us alleviate some of the structural
               inequalities within higher education, we cannot achieve maximum justice until we
               address the problem of precarity within our own communities.

            This paper explores multilingual minimal computing and plain text for Indian literatures. It focuses on our workflow designed to produce multilingual, annotated digital critical editions of Indian-language poetry, and to model, explicate, and visualize their poetics. In the absence of digital scholarly corpora, resources developed by citizen scholars working outside of academia are essential; for our team and audience, this includes free and open source solutions â including optical character recognition tools â developed in other contexts. Modeling formal, metrical, thematic, and rhythmic structures opens up the possibility for computer-assisted scholarly analysis across the variously related languages and literary histories of India, which are usually treated in isolation. Positioning our work as a form of minimal computing, we discuss our workflow as a jugaad â a North Indian term for reuse and innovation in the presence of constraints.

            This essay offers a case study of the ZHI project, a digital craftsmanship project
               showcasing the beauty of traditional craftsmanship at three levels: knowing, making, and
               intelligence. The project began with a Designer Residency Program and was developed to
               answer three crucial questions: (1) How could we bridge the gap between enthusiastic
               outsiders and little-known creators of intangible cultural heritage? (2) How could we
               help students understand and participate in craftwork? and (3) How could we facilitate
               sustainable knowledge production about intangible cultural heritage among the audiences,
               students, and craftsmen so everyone benefits and contributes? The ZHI project uses
               minimal computing strategies to encourage craftspeople to pass their skills and
               knowledge onto others, particularly younger generations, through digitization and online
               exhibitions that use minimal computing practices. The project provides user-friendly,
               accessible information to researchers and craftspeople who do not possess expensive
               digital equipment or high-level technical skills. This offers them opportunities to
               virtually present their craft and research, share knowledge, and tell their own stories

            Access to audio collections is often restricted by institutions for copyright,

               annotations that stands in the way of all levels of access and use. Libraries,
               archives, and museums (LAMs) often hold physical audio artifacts that are unmarked
               and lacking important identifiable information such as title, date, location,
               subject, participants, or context. Annotating is only one of a list of scholarly
               primitives including discovering, comparing, referring, sampling, illustrating, and
               representing . IIIF (International Image

               giving users the ability to perform these primitives with images held in cultural
               heritage institutions. The AudiAnnotate project builds on the new IIIF standards for

            Improving methods of stylometrics and classification so that they give good results
               with small texts is the focus of much research in the digital humanities and in the
               NLP community more generally. Recent work  has suggested
               that an approach using combinations of shallow and deep morpho-syntactic information
               can be quite successful. But because the data in that study were taken from hand
               annotated dependency treebanks, the wider applicability of such an approach remains
               in question. The present paper seeks to answer this question by using
               machine-generated morphological and syntactic annotations as the basis for a
               closed-set classification experiment. Texts were parsed according to the Universal
               Dependency schema using the âudpipeâ package for R. Experiments were carried out
               on data from several languages covering a range of morphological complexity. To limit
               confounders, consideration of vocabulary was excluded. Results were quite promising,
               and, not surprisingly, a more complex morphology correlates with better accuracy
               (e.g., 100-token texts in Polish: 88% correct; 100-token texts in English: 74%).The
               method presented here has particular advantages for stylometrics as practiced in
               literary analysis and other fields in the humanities. The Universal Dependency
               annotation categories are generally similar to those used in traditional grammars.
               Thus, the variables which serve to distinguish the style of a given author are
               relatively easier to interpret and understand than, for example, are character
               n-grams or function words. This fact, combined with the availability of easy-to-use
               dependency parsers, opens up the study of a syntax-centered stylometrics to persons
               with a wide range of expertise. Even students at the early stages of their studies
               can identify and investigate the morpho-syntactic âsignatureâ of a particular
               author. Therefore, the characterization of texts based on computational annotation of
               this type deserves a place in classification studies because of its combination of
               good results and good interpretability.

               of the everyday lives of Black residents of Philadelphiaâs Seventh Ward. It does so

               to recover, recreate, and preserve The Philadelphia
                  Negro using digital and geospatial technologies to document historical and
               contemporary patterns relating to race and class. Beginning with an exploration of
               primary source documents that provide new details about how Du Bois went about his
               original research, we focus on the humanities and social science research methods
               that he employed. Of note is the color-coded parcel-level map Du Bois created to
               illustrate Black social class status, which reflected both the influence of the
               Social Survey Movement and Du Boisâ efforts to present a new understanding of the
               color line. His findings were groundbreaking, considering that most white scientists
               of his time assumed Black people to be biologically inferior and socially homogeneous.
               Instead, he documented the variability and social stratification within
               Philadelphiaâs Black population and the systematic exclusion they faced because of
               anti-Black racism. Our ongoing project â The WARD: Race and Class
                  in Du Boisâ Seventh Ward, which seeks to recreate Du Boisâ study â
               includes new technologies and participatory research methods that engage high school
               and college students. In-depth, intergenerational oral histories conducted with
               students also add a new dimension to this work and complement our high school
               curriculum, which incorporates online mapping, documentaries, a board game, a walking
               tour, and a mural to engage others to create their own primary sources. This research
               provides a historical context for todayâs racial tensions as we seek new ways to
               address the 21st century color line.

                    that appeared in the early months of 2020, the event described here was designed
                    as both an exercise in critical making and a response to the constraints of the
                    virtual incunabular state so many organisations found themselves in, attempting
                    to recreate their planned face-to-face meetings in virtual formats without due
                    consideration of the affordances and constraints of each context. As a
                    structurally distributed organisation, the DARIAH European Research
                    Infrastructure as event host was able to bring its experience of virtual
                    interaction to the recosideration of these challenges, but also the sensitivity
                    to research processes and practices that is central to our positioning in the
                    digital humanities. As such, the resulting model for a virtual event, realised
                    in May 2020 and described in this paper, was built upon a very self-conscious
                    set of considerations, meta-reflection, and goals regarding what we might
                    tacitly and could expect from a virtual event. The instruments designed to
                    deliver this, as well as their performance in practice, is documented alongside
                    consideration of what lessons the experience delivers about both virtual
                    meetings and more generally about the interactions of scholarly communities.

                [en]
            
            In late 11th century, a reform carried out by Wang Anshi (1021â1086) brought about
               controversies and initiated a series of political struggles between factionalized
               reformers and anti-reformers. The origin and nature of these factionalized struggles
               have been discussed for a long time among scholars. In this paper, we discuss the
               issue based on the literary and political relationships among people in the era of
               the reform. First, two matrices are respectively constructed of the literary and
               political relations among these people based on the data collected from CBDB (China
               Biographical Database). Then a Poission-Gamma factorization model is adopted to
               obtain the key factors of the matrices, and the Louvain Modularity algorithm is used
               for community detection. The results show that people engaging in similar literary
               pursuits were more likely to share political interests and people belonging to the
               same literary groups were more likely to join in the same political groups,
               suggesting. Ensuing discussions illustrate that peopleâs differing academic views indeed
               played a shaping role in the formation and exacerbation of factionalized struggle,
               for which the mechanism unfolded herein of âliterati politicsâ was highly

                [en]
            
            Our study discusses the automated transcription with deep learning methods of a
               digital newspaper collection printed in a historical language, Arabic-script Ottoman
               Turkish (OT), dating to the late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century. We situate
               OT text collections within a larger history of digitization of periodicals,
               underscoring special challenges faced by Arabic script languages. Our paper approaches the question of automated transcription of non-Latin script languages, such
               as OT, from the broader perspective of debates surrounding OCR use for historical
               archives. In our study with OT, we have opted for training handwritten text
               recognition (HTR) models that generate transcriptions in the left-to-right, Latin
               writing system familiar to contemporary readers of Turkish, and not, as some scholars
               may expect, in right-to-left Arabic script text. As a one-to-one correspondence
               between the writing systems of OT and modern Turkish does not exist, we also discuss
               approaches to transcription and the creation of ground truth and argue that the
               challenges faced in the training of HTR models also draw into question
               straightforward notions of transcription, especially where divergent writing systems
               are involved. Finally, we reflect on potential domain bias of HTR models in other
               historical languages exhibiting spatio-temporal variance as well as the significance
               of working between writing systems for language communities that also have
               experienced language reform and script change.

            Digital literary studies constitutes a broad church.Â  However, the field tends to
               divide into, at one pole, quantitative, macro-level studies of historical literary

            Catalogue records underpin the audit, curatorial, and public access functions of
               collecting institutions. And they are relied upon by many humanities researchers, and
               increasingly those looking to analyse collection holdings at scale. However, far from
               being a neutral record of collection holdings, catalogues are the products of
               cataloguing labour, often spanning many decades, and so are subject to various biases
               and inequities. Understanding how collection catalogues are shaped by their histories
               is then crucial for addressing many of the contemporary challenges faced by
               cataloguing professionals and for enhancing their use in humanities research, as well
               as for opening up new directions for historical research. This paper contributes a
               computationally-based approach for generating new and important knowledge about
               catalogues, in particular for investigating how a catalogue is shaped by an earlier
               one. We contend that understanding at scale the transmission of records and style
               from one catalogue to another requires the use of computational techniques to detect
               and analyse the various ways in which transmission manifests across a catalogue. 
            Our case study concerns the transmission of Mary Dorothy Georgeâs voice through time,
               across space, and between mediums, from the 1930s to the late-twentieth century and
               beyond, from the British Museum in London to the Lewis Walpole Library in Farmington,
               Connecticut, from printed volumes to networked digital data. It aims to show how
               transmission happens, how it can be found, and how it can be characterised. Detecting
               and characterising transmission is important because cataloguers like George are the
               interlocuters between us and the pasts they described, legacy voices that refuse to
               stay in their historical place, and whose raced, sexed, and classed influence on the
               future should not go unchecked.
            Our contributions are relevant both for historical research into catalogues and
               cataloguing, knowledge organisation and infrastructure, and cultural organisations,
               and for cataloguing practitioners seeking to rationalise/review their catalogues to
               improve user experience, address systemic inequalities in object representation, and
               develop best practice for future work. Furthermore, in broad terms, by contributing
               to the generation of new knowledge about the biases/inequities of catalogues our work
               will enable new and better research into the collections that catalogues
               describe.

            Linking large digitized newspaper corpora in different languages that have become
               available in national and state libraries opens up new possibilities for the
               computational analysis of patterns of information flow across national and linguistic
               boundaries. The significant contribution this article presents is to demonstrate how
               word vector models can be used to explore the way concepts have shifted in meaning
               over time, as they migrated across space, by comparing newspapers from different
               countries published between 1840 and 1914. We define a concept, rather pragmatically,
               as a key term or core idea that has been used in historical discourse: an abstraction
               or mental representation that has served as a building block for thoughts and
               beliefs. We use historical newspapers in English, Finnish, German and Swedish from
               collections in the UK, US, Germany, and Finland, as well as the Europeana collection.
               As use cases, we analyze how the different conceptual constructs of ânationâ and
               âillnessâ emerged and changed between 1840 and 1920. Conceptual change over time is
               simulated by creating a series of overlapping word vector models, each spanning ten
               years. Historical vocabularies are retrieved on the basis of vector space proximity.
               Conceptual change across space is simulated by comparing the historical change of
               vocabularies in newspaper collections from different nations in several languages.
               This computational approach to conceptual history opens up new ways to identify
               patterns in public discourse over longer periods of time and across borders.

            Syuzhet is a dictionary-based tool for the sentiment analysis of literary texts that

               literary texts. However, there have been doubts about sentiment analysis in the
               digital humanities field, especially after Swaffordâs impactful critique of Syuzhet.
               Since it is impossible to achieve 100% accuracy in sentiment analysis, we should
               embrace the imperfection and continue to use Syuzhet while also making efforts to

            Network representation is a crucial topic in historical social network analysis. The
               debate around their value and connotations, led by humanist scholars, is today more
               relevant then ever, seeing how common these representations are as support for
               historical analysis. Force-directed networks, in particular, are popular as they can
               be developed relatively quickly, and reveal patterns and structures in data. The
               underlying algorithms, although powerful in revealing hidden patterns, do not retain
               meaningful structure and existing hierarchies within historical social networks. In
               this article, we question the foreign aspect of this structure that force-directed
               layout create in historical datasets. We explore the importance of hierarchy in
               social networks, and investigate whether hierarchiesÂ  - strongly present within our
               models of social structure - affect our perception of social network data. Results
               from our user evaluation indicate that hierarchical network representations reduce
               cognitive load and leads to more frequent and deeper insights into historical social
               networks. We also find that users report a preference for the hierarchical graph
               representation. We analyse these findings in light of the broader discussion on the
               value of force-directed network representations within humanistic research, and
               introduce open questions for future work in this line of research.Â

               instead of being a crowing event for conciliatory efforts. From the perspective of
               political communication, New Yearâs speeches fulfil a triple function in the
               intersection of the past, the present and the future. First, they summarise the past
               year from the perspective of the political leadership and, hence, recall, reconstruct
               and remind the most important events of the year. Second, New Yearâs speeches
               describe the present and, thus, can be understood and analysed as reality
               constructions, as windows to the current state of affairs. And third, New Yearâs
               speeches serve as road maps to the future, into the new year. In this sense, a New
               Yearâs speeches summarises the most important future challenges, expectations and
               opportunities.Â 
            This article stems from the assumption that a nonlinear analysis of textual data
               based on network analysis could provide us with new ontological understanding about
               structural coherence and holes within a document corpora. It adopts a different
               viewpoint to discourse analysis based on social network analysis. The paper
               introduces a nonlinear way to analyse texts as networks in order to visualise and
               analyse how concepts are connected and to explore structural closeness and holes
               within a corpus of unstructured textual documents.
            The results indicate a discursive turn in Germany, Austria and Switzerland after the
               breakout of the global financial crisis in 2008. But at the same time, the results
               evidence similarities across the three countries how the crisis and its impact was
               framed to discourses. In all countries, the use of concepts related to crisis and
               insecurity has increased dramatically since 2008. However, this vocabulary is not
               solely limited to the financial crisis. The âinsecurity and
                  crisisâ frame referred both to the financial crisis, the armed conflict
               in Ukraine and to the refugee crisis.

            Named entity recognition is an advantageous technique with an increasing presence in
               digital humanities. In theory, automatic detection and recovery of named entities can provide new ways 
               of looking up unedited information in edited sources and can allow the parsing of a massive amount of

               on different datasets. Different models were trained on a vast dataset of Burgundian diplomatic charters
               from the 9th to 14th centuries and validated by using general and century ad hoc models tested on short
               sets of Parisian, English, Italian and Spanish charters. We present the results of cross-validation in each
               case and we discuss the implications of these results for the history of medieval place-names and personal names.

                Virginia Woolf writes in her novel Orlando that âit is clothes that wear us and
                    not we them; we may make them take to mould of arm or breast, but they mould our
                    hearts, our brains, our tongues to their liking.â Her observation remains vital
                    to the authorâs longstanding, feminist critique of essentializing discourses,
                    but it also gives recourse to the ways our computational methods of studying
                    literature and its history sometimes âmould [â¦] to their likingâ their objects.
                    When studying style and gender, digital humanists have tended to use
                    computational methods to trace embedded, hidden linguistic structures, showing
                    how they can contain, conceal, and condition the gendered lives of social groups
                    and cultural milieus. In this essay, we present a stylometric case study â Woolfâs
                    Orlando â that reminds us why, when dealing with gender in modern literature,
                    computational critics must pay particular care when addressing and generalizing
                    from modernismâs experimental styles. We outline the limitations of our own and
                    prior approaches to questions of gender and literary style, and we ask whether
                    flawed stylometric analyses can acquaint us with ways that modernismâs stylistic
                    innovations productively haunt the conclusions of digital literary
                    criticism.

            The increasing roles of machine learning and artificial intelligence in the construction
               of cultural heritage and humanities datasets necessitate critical examination of the
               myriad biases introduced by machines, algorithms, and the humans who build and deploy
               them. From image classification to optical character recognition, the effects of
               decisions ostensibly made by machines compound through the digitization pipeline and
               redouble in each step, mediating our interactions with digitally-rendered artifacts
               through the search and discovery process. As a result, scholars within the digital
               humanities community have begun advocating for the proper contextualization of cultural
               heritage datasets within the socio-technical systems in which they are created and
               utilized. One such approach to this contextualization is the data
                  archaeology, a form of humanistic excavation of a dataset that Paul Fyfe defines
               as ârecover[ing] and reconstitut[ing] media objects within their changing ecologiesâ
               . Within critical data studies, this excavation of a dataset - including its
               construction and mediation via machine learning - has proven to be a capacious approach.
               However, the data archaeology has yet to be adopted as standard practice among cultural
               heritage practitioners who produce such datasets with machine learning. 
            
            In this article, I present a data archaeology of the Library of Congressâs Newspaper Navigator dataset, which I created as part of the
               Library of Congressâs Innovator in Residence program . The dataset
               consists of visual content extracted from 16 million historic newspaper pages in the Chronicling America database using machine learning techniques. In
               this case study, I examine the manifold ways in which a Chronicling
                  America newspaper page is transmuted and decontextualized during its journey
               from a physical artifact to a series of probabilistic photographs, illustrations, maps,
               comics, cartoons, headlines, and advertisements in the Newspaper
                  Navigator dataset . Accordingly, I draw from fields of scholarship
               including media archaeology, critical data studies, science and technology studies, and
               the autoethnography throughout. 
            
            To excavate the Newspaper Navigator dataset, I consider
               the digitization journeys of four different pages in Black newspapers included in Chronicling America, all of which reproduce the same photograph of
               W.E.B. Du Bois in an article announcing the launch of The Crisis,
               the official magazine of the NAACP. In tracing the newspaper pagesâ journeys, I unpack
               how each step in the Chronicling America and Newspaper Navigator pipelines, such as the imaging process and the construction
               of training data, not only imprints bias on the resulting Newspaper
                  Navigator dataset but also propagates the bias through the pipeline via the
               machine learning algorithms employed. Along the way, I investigate the limitations of
               the Newspaper Navigator dataset and machine learning techniques
               more generally as they relate to cultural heritage, with a particular focus on
               marginalization and erasure via algorithmic bias, which implicitly rewrites the archive
               itself. 
            In presenting this case study, I argue for the value of the data archaeology as a
               mechanism for contextualizing and critically examining cultural heritage datasets within
               the communities that create, release, and utilize them. I offer this autoethnographic
               investigation of the Newspaper Navigator dataset in the hope that
               it will be considered not only by users of this dataset in particular but also by
               digital humanities practitioners and end users of cultural heritage datasets writ large.

                [en]
            Handwritten character recognition is a challenging
               pattern recognition problem due to the inconsistency of the handwritten scripts and
               the lack of accurate labeled data. Historical documents written in cursive are even
               more challenging as characters have unique and varying shapes. Frequently, words are
               linked by lines and ornamental doodles. When historical documents are digitized, the
               images contain various types of noise and degradation, which further complicates the
               recognition of characters. In this paper, we present an empirical study of how well
               state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification
               perform for the task of recognizing handwritten characters in seventeenth-century
               Spanish American notarial scripts. Professional historians, paleography experts and
               trained labelers were involved in preparing the labeled dataset of Spanish
               characters for training the CNNs. The
               labeled dataset used in this experiment was created from the manuscripts written by
               one of the multiple scribes that contributed to the collection of approximately
               220,000 digitized images of notary records housed at the
               Archivo General de la NaciÃ³n Argentina (National
               Archives). We removed the noise in these images by applying standard image
               processing techniques. After training different CNNs, we computed the classification
               accuracy for all the characters. We observed that ResNet-50 achieved a promising
               accuracy of 97.08% compared to InceptionResnet-V2, Inception-V3, and VGG-16, which
               achieved 96.66%, 96.33% and 70.91%, respectively.

                [en]
            
            Previous studies indicate that the capacity of media to influence the salience of
               issues in the public realm is strongly dependent on specific attributes that
               characterize these issues. In this work, we investigate two internal aspects of issue
               types related to the attribute of duration. First, we address whether news stories
               belonging to different issue types can be identified and represented using a set of
               quantifiable temporal dimensions (i.e. lifespan, intensity, and burstiness). Second,
               we conduct a qualitative analysis to investigate whether news stories of different
               issue types have different narrative patterns, regardless of their specific topic. We
               use a corpus of 50,385 political news articles in Spanish from 2018 as a case study,
               and propose a novel system to aggregate the articles into stories. Our results show
               that stories belonging to different issue types do have distinguishing behaviours,
               especially along the intensity dimension. At the same time, the qualitative analysis
               indicates a tendency to associate narrative patterns to issue types. This analysis
               shows the potential of using news stories as research units to study framing
               strategies.Â

               researchers who participated in projects funded by the first round of HWW Global
               Midwest awards. Participants were asked about the aims of their collaborative
               projects, the processes for developing their collaborations, the types of resources
               used to support collaboration and project management (and whether additional

            Current research in computer vision highlights the potential of using computational
               methods to analyze and access large datasets of real images and videos, performing
               tasks such as object detection or finding visual similarities. This essay describes
               how the application of these computational methods to digital art data transforms
               information inherent in images into new knowledge. We support this claim by
               presenting various research examples in the field of digital art history, which
               utilize computational methods for art analysis. We argue that in order to create new
               knowledge, we must involve transformative processes â from analog to digital data and
               digital to computational methods. Traditional methods used in art history to access
               datasets, link or edit images provide suggestions and validations for current
               practices, but are not sufficient role models for the processing of digital data
               because they were developed under varying technological conditions and standards and
               within a different historical context. Aby Warburgâs (1866-1929) Mnemosyne Atlas, which aimed to visualize visual continuities from
               antiquity to the Renaissance, is one method often cited in the context of digital
               humanities. We argue that the characteristics of digital data, for example being
               reproducible or modifiable, require innovative computer methods that do not have a
               direct analog counterpart. Our argument is based on the success of current projects
               and personal experience: the authors have expertise in computer vision and art
               history. They have created and applied computational methods to analyze art data and
               are thus able to identify shortcomings of traditional approaches and suggest possible
               solutions. Eventually this essay presents solutions, which demonstrate the great
               potential of computational methods for a data analysis: approaches enable an easy and
               explorative access to digital image collections through visualization techniques or
               an automatic object search. Computational methods establish links between thousands
               of images, thereby identifying the adaptation of specific motifs or styles by artists
               over time, or enable a conspicuous editing of images, thus providing new insights for
               art history unobtainable with analog methods.

                The aim of this article is to present a model for representing in an explicit and
                    formal way the diachronic evolution of concepts and terms in a given domain, so
                    that this formalization can be machine-actionable. The approach we here propose
                    is based on Semantic Web technologies in order to guarantee interoperability and
                    reuse across scientific communities of diachronic terminological resources that
                    can be thus easily accessed, interconnected and mutually enriched. More
                    specifically, the representation of dynamic evolution of terms and concepts was
                    performed in OWL using the N-ary relations mechanisms. In addition, a set of
                    SWRL rules was set up, in order to automatically identify the evolution of the
                    concepts evoked within a text, as well as the terms representing these concepts.
                    Our model was adopted to formally represent diachronic aspects of Saussureâs
                    terminology as they emerge from his works. An example will be provided to
                    highlight the potential of such a knowledge structuration for gaining a wider
                    understanding of the profound terminological and conceptual changes brought
                    about by the paradigmatic and epistemological revolutions in sciences.

                [en]
            
            To date, there has been relatively little discussion of how the UK doctoral funding
               landscape shapes digital humanities pedagogy for postgraduate research students. This
               article sets out to address this relative lack, by introducing the inter- and
               multi-disciplinary context in which many students in the UK work. We examine the
               phenomenon of students who are not necessarily interested in becoming DH
               practitioners, but have identified DH as a knowledge gap in their own disciplinary
               practice. Such a realisation changes the nature of the learner within DH communities
               of practice, requiring a different form of learning.
            This study therefore explores learning within a community of practice, the inter- and
               multi-disciplinary space in which digital humanities practitioners operate. First,
               drawing on the diverse disciplinary landscape, it highlights an individual's learning
               journey through self-determined learning (heutagogy). Second, it outlines an idea of
               digital humanities pedagogy for postgraduate research based on current frameworks of
               digital literacies and broader researcher development in the UK, framing research
               activity as learning. Third, it presents the DEAR model for learning and teaching
               design, which is based on four principles: Diversity; Employability; Application; and
               Reflection. Finally, it provides an evaluation of the DEAR model in the context of
               one UK Doctoral Training Partnership (DTP). It contributes to understanding of
               pedagogical practices for doctoral-level DH training and provides a set of
               recommendations for instructors to adopt and adapt these pedagogical principles in
               their own programmes.

                [en]
            
            Citing and referencing is an important aspect of scholarship as it makes research
               processes retraceable and transparent. Over centuries citation practices have been
               optimized for print publications. However, the digital revolution and the increased
               scholarly output online provide new challenges. For instance, the physical form of
               the book which was the basis for citation styles in the past is replaces by different
               types of online resources of which only some resemble books. Another issue is that
               digital resources on the internet are not as durable as printed books that are
               distributed in multiple copies in libraries across the world. For scholarly citation
               this is a problem as a website referenced today, might not be available tomorrow or
               might have changed its address which is frequently used for referencing. Â Editions,
               in print or digital, are supposed to be stable reference points for scholarly
               discourse as discussions the scholarly community engages today should still be
               reproducible in 50 or 100 years â as it is the case with printed scholarly editions
               from the 19th century. Consequently, assurance of long-term availability of resources
               and clarity of how and what to cite in a digital edition is vital. That the lack of
               providing this kind of assurance and information makes online resources less
               attractive for citation has been shown in a recently published survey using as a case
               study British History Online and Early English Books Online. The survey assessed if
               researchers prefer to cite print or digital resources and the results indicate that
               there is still a very strong âculture of non-citationâ of electronic resources
               among students and researchers in the humanities. The authors of the study suggest
               that creators of web content can contribute to facilitate the citation of digital
               resources by providing recommendations on how to cite a resource and by having a
               solid permalink strategy .The following study
               tries to explore this topic further. After a brief introduction and discussion of the
               key issues of digital citation such as âbroken linksâ and strategies to provide
               persistent identifiers for the citation and access of online content, the results of
               a survey of 100 digital scholarly editions will be presented. The survey focuses on
               citation recommendations provided and permalink strategies used by digital scholarly
               editions. In this context the paper will look at how permalink/PID strategies and
               citation recommendations can make digital editions better citable. A closer look will
               be taken at citation recommendations of selected editions in order to highlight
               possible solutions.

            Since there has been a recent trend to establishing virtual museums, which various

               the nature of virtual and/or digital museums by focusing on their particular

               representations in the virtual space and/or virtual museums could extend conventional
               or physical museum space, leading to enhanced visitor attraction and experience. The
               paper thus focuses on the virtual museum as an interdisciplinary and
               transdisciplinary object of investigation from the perspective of museology and
               digital humanities and seeks to ascertain whether scholarly and practical impacts are
               achieved. It also analyses the expected impacts on practical museum work and visitor

               regarding how to create an ontology in Iranian architectural history, what
               consideration must be addressed here, and how to resolve problematic issues in
               developing an ontology in a field such as Iranian architectural history, which lacks
               a formalized knowledge. The paper is organized into two parts. It primarily presents
               a discussion on the specific domain of architectural history and what it encompasses
               and moves on to examine why it is deemed complicated. After that, the process of
               creating Iranian architectural history ontology and the methodology applied to match
               the intended domain is explained. In the second part of the paper, the content of the
               developed ontology is discussed, which includes various parts of the ontology and
               what it implies to illustrate how the structure of ontology helps in logically
               representing the domain in a machine-readable format.

                Katherine Bode theorizes a new approach to âdata richâ
                    literary history, in which the researcher constructs a âa

                    critical apparatus. Bode challenges the rhetoric around distant
                        reading, arguing it recapitulates the historical oversights of
                    New Criticism. A World of Fiction comprises a book
                    and paired database which apply this framework to the fiction published in

                    ideas about the gender of Australian fiction authors, the networks of influence
                    among provincial and metropolitan newspapers, and the national character of

            This paper offers a case study of the development of Hands-On Reading (https://hands-on-reading.atnu.ncl.ac.uk/login), a web app that explores the
               interconnections between digital reading and writing. The app was created as part of
               the AHRC-funded project âManuscripts after Print c.1450-1550:
                  Producing and Reading Books during Technological Change,â which ran at

               to enable the project to ask two crucial questions: why does handwriting have an

                In this article, we present our reflections on hermeneutic data visualizations
                    for digital literary studies. Hermeneutic approaches in the digital humanities
                    have been rather agnostic about the epistemological premises of hermeneutic
                    theory. These can be summarized as (1) differentiation author/text, (2)
                    hermeneutic circle and (3) dependency text/recipient. In this article, we
                    present the concept of hermeneutic visualization as a means of bridging the gap
                    between âclassicâ literary hermeneutics and the emerging
                    practice of digital literary hermeneutics. Since data visualization is based on
                    epistemological premises stemming from the natural or social sciences, it is not
                    well-equipped to meet hermeneutic demands. In this article, we argue that the
                    digital humanities can meet hermeneutic demands through a critical interface and
                    visualization concept. We discuss four postulates that can be used as guidelines
                    and help transform âmore traditionalâ data visualization into
                    hermeneutic visualization, while respecting the epistemological foundations of
                    hermeneutic theory. We demonstrate the usefulness of the postulates with an
                    interactive prototype Stereoscope designed to
                    support them.In our article, we refer to the discussions and results of
                        the three-year research project Three-Dimensional
                            Dynamic Data Visualisation and Exploration for Digital Humanities

                        The considerations on hermeneutic visualizations presented here are
                        therefore the result of a very productive collaboration. Therefore we cannot
                        claim the presented ideas as our own.

            There are a number of risks to interpretability found in the growing use of
               complicated computational methods within the humanities. Greater attention needs to
               be given to the format and presentation of the underlying data and the interpretation
               of any data-derived results. Visually appealing graphic renderings of data, high
               classification accuracy and confidence scores, and impressive summary statistics can
               be rhetorically structured to appeal to preconceived notions and commonplace
               understandings. While making arguments from the summary of significant features might
               be permissible in some applications of what is now commonly called data science,
               humanistic uses of computation put forward in the service of academic arguments
               require much greater access to and grounding in interpretable digital objects. When
               features are derived from text, these underlying features need to be shown and
               interpreted. This essay argues that claims made on behalf of computational models
               need to be evaluated and warranted by a set of shared assumptions and the ability to
               test and verify that the data are indeed comprehensible according to the norms of the
               shared interpretative community.

            Alterations in historical manuscripts such as letters represent a promising field of
               research. On the one hand, they help understand the construction of text. On the
               other hand, topics that are being considered sensitive at the time of the manuscript
               gain coherence and contextuality when taking alterations into account, especially in
               the case of deletions. The analysis of alterations in manuscripts, though, is a
               traditionally very tedious work. In this paper, we present a machine learning-based
               approach to help categorize alterations in documents. In particular, we present a new
               probabilistic model (Alteration Latent Dirichlet Allocation, alterLDA in
               the following) that categorizes content-related alterations. The method proposed here
               is developed based on experiments carried out on the digital scholarly edition Berlin Intellectuals, for which alterLDA
               achieves high performance in the recognition of alterations on labelled data. On
               unlabelled data, applying alterLDA leads to interesting new insights
               into the alteration behavior of authors, editors and other manuscript contributors,
               as well as insights into sensitive topics in the correspondence of Berlin
               intellectuals around 1800. In addition to the findings based on the digital scholarly
               edition Berlin Intellectuals, we present a general
               framework for the analysis of text genesis that can be used in the context of other
               digital resources representing document variants. To that end, we present in detail
               the methodological steps that are to be followed in order to achieve such results,
               giving thereby a prime example of a Machine Learning application in the Digital

          more prominent place in the field. Whether the creation, analysis, and sharing of
          audiovisual data or audiovisual ways of communicating scholarly knowledge, scholars are
          building compelling avenues of inquiry that are changing how we know, what we know, and
          why we know in the digital humanities (DH). These epistemological shifts not only
          challenge existing methodological and theoretical pathways within the field of audiovisual
          studies, but most importantly defy existing knowledge hierarchies within the entire field
          of DH.

          Web","Abstract
                [en]
        Current theories about the significance of annotations in literary studies are based
          primarily on assumptions developed in print culture about verbal texts. In these textual
          theories, the text is typically present, authorized, and centralized as the ideal text for
          an ideal reader, and to annotate is to add authorized comments in a sociotechnical system
          that includes publication, dissemination, and reception. To audiate is to imagine a song
          that's not playing. In music learning theory, audiation is based on the concept that the
          musician learns to play music by developing their own musical aptitude, her individual
          interpretation of a musical score based on her particular experience of the music. This
          short article introduces audiation as an alternate theoretical framing for articulating
          the significance of personal literary annotations. Comparing commentary on psalms in the
          Middle Ages to IIIF (International Image Interoperability Framework) web annotations, we
          use the concept of audiation to situate annotations within literary study in terms of a
          more capacious understanding of the individual's interpretation of text and of the reading
          experience as part of an unauthorized, distributed, and decentralized system. By bringing
          together theories and technologies of annotation with sound, we offer the concept of
          audiated annotations as a means to re-evaluate modes of access, discovery, and analysis of
          cultural objects in digital sound studies.

        Over the past decade, podcasting has grown into one of the most important media forms in
          the world. This article argues that podcastingâs unique technical affordances â
          particularly RSS feeds and user-entered metadata â open up productive methods for
          exploring the cultural practices and meanings of the medium. We share three different
          methods for studying RSS feeds and podcast metadata: 1) visualizing how topics and
          keywords trend over time; 2) visualizing networks of commonly associated keywords entered
          by podcasters; and 3) analyzing norms and common practices for the duration of podcasts
          (as a time-based media format, podcasting is unusual in that it is not bound by the
          programming schedules and technical limitations that provide strict parameters for most
          audiovisual forms). The methods and preliminary results reveal how metadata can function
          as a surrogate for studying large collections of time-based media objects. Yet our study
          also shows that, when it comes to born digital media, the metadata are never fully
          separate from the objects they describe. We argue that future work in AV in DH needs to
          delineate between methods best suited for digitized media collections compared to those
          most appropriate for born digital media collections.

          world over its 24 years of activity. The project brings together research organizations
          with a dual historical and technological perspective. ANTRACT's goal is to study the
          production process, the film content, the way historical events are represented and the
          audience reception of Les ActualitÃ©s FranÃ§aises newsreels
          using innovative AI-based data processing tools developed by partners specialized in
          image, audio, and text analysis. This article focuses on the data processing apparatus and
          tools of the project. Automatic content analysis is used to select data, to segment video
          units and typescript images, and to align them with their archival description. Automatic
          speech recognition provides a textual representation and natural language processing can
          extract named entities from the voice-over recording; automatic visual analysis is applied
          to detect and recognize faces of well-known characters in videos. These multifaceted data

          integrates documentation, information retrieval, and hypermedia capabilities within a
          single environment based on the Semantic Web standards. The complete corpus of Les ActualitÃ©s FranÃ§aises, enriched with data and metadata, will

        This article is a classroom case study of the Intellectual Mixtape Project, an
          AudioVisualÂ digital humanities module. The intellectual mixtape uses jazz and hip hop as
          aÂ framework to create an audio compilation and âconversationâ that samples
          literary-audioÂ texts (such as SunRa speeches, Octavia Butler interviews, Tracy K. Smithâs
          poetryÂ readings, etc.). Each track of the intellectual mixtape has three audios: 1) the
          literary-audio texts from the syllabus, 2) the studentsâ voice in their own words, and 3)
          an audioÂ of the studentsâ choice. As a companion to each track, students write 500 words
          of linerÂ notes that must include the title of their track and their curation and mixing
          decisions.Students then publish their entire intellectual mixtape (three or more tracks)
          with originalÂ or âremixedâ cover art on an online platform.
        The first part of the study will discuss the structure of the intellectual
          mixtapeÂ assignments. In these assignments, students are provided with literary-audio
          texts,Â required to complete and submit audio homework assignments, and taught the basics
          ofÂ audio editing. This method of teaching and analyzing literature shifts the practice
          ofÂ literary analysis from top down approaches that privileges the authority of the text
          andÂ instead encourages the student to âconverseâ with the text to
          create new knowledge.Â This methods also reflects the artistic practice of Afrofuturist
          artists and theorist whoÂ improvise, remix, and sample to create their work.
        The second part of the study will discuss a performance and midterm adaptation of
          theÂ Intellectual Mixtape Project entitled Sound of Space: An Interactive
          AfrofuturistÂ Experience. âSound of Spaceâ was an immersive
          performance with four-sensoryÂ stations that featured Afrofuturist themes. The midterm
          adaptation was showcased inÂ the Cube, a four-story high, state-of-the-art multimedia black
          box theater at VirginiaÂ Tech. In preparation for the performance, students merged sound
          engineering, 360Â degree-video-projection, improvisational performance, and light design.
            âSound ofÂ Spaceâ introduced students and audiencesâ to an
          immersive Afrofuturist-audioÂ experience and pushed the boundaries of literary
          analysis.
        The third part of the study will address challenges with the Intellectual Mixtape
          Project.Â Challenges include finding relevant literary-audio texts and dealing with the
          manyÂ limitations imposed by U.S. copyright law. Some ways to address the
          challengesÂ imposed by U.S. copyright law might be to 1) reclassify sampling audio as a
          form ofÂ quotation, 2) use databases of copyright-free music, 3) find culturally
          significant worksÂ from lesser-known artists who will license their tracks, and/or 4) pay
          royalties.

          Sonification As Synesthetic AudioVisual Digital Humanities","Abstract
                [en]
        Computers have the capacity to transpose the pixels, shapes, and other features of visual
          material into sound. This act of data correlation between the visual and the audial
          produces a new artifact, a sonic composition created from the visual source. The new
          artifact, however, correlates precisely to data in the original, thus allowing for fresh
          ways of perceiving its form, content, and context. Seeming to distort the visual object
          into an aural one paradoxically allows an observer to observe the visual evidence anew,
          with more accuracy. A kind of generative, synesthetic criticism becomes possible by
          cutting across typical boundaries between the visual and the audio, the optic and the
          aural. Listening to as well as looking at visual artifacts by way of digital
          transpositions of data enables better close readings, more compelling interpretations, and
          deeper contextual understandings. Building on my earlier scholarship into image glitching,
          remixing, and sonification, this essay investigates a photograph of Joan Baez performing
          at the Greek Amphitheater in Berkeley, California, during the early 1960s. The image comes
          from my project on the Berkeley Folk Music Festival and the history of the folk music
          revival on the West Coast of the United States. Here, the use of digital image
          sonification becomes particularly intriguing. While we cannot magically recover the music
          being made in the photograph, we can more closely attend to the ghosts of sound within the
          silent snapshot. Digital image sonification does not recover the music itself, but it does
          help to amplify issues of gender, power, embodiment, spectacle, performance, hierarchy,
          and performance in my perceptions of Baez making music in the photograph. Using the ear as
          well as the eye to scan the image for its multiple levels of meaning leads to unsuspected
          perceptions, which then support more revealing analysis. In digital image sonification, a
          cyborgian dance of data, signal, image, sound, history, and human perception emerges,
          activating visual materials for renewed scrutiny. In doing so, this mode of AudioVisual DH
          activates the scholarly imagination in promising new ways.

          Spotify and iTunes has to a large extend outperformed traditional playlist radio, and the
          global dissemination of software generated playlists in public service radio stations in
          the 1990s has superseded the passionate music radio host. But digitization has also
          changed the way we can do research in radio. In Denmark digitization of almost all radio
          programming back to 1989, have made it possible to actually listen to the archive to
          investigate how radio content has changed historically. This article investigates the
          research question: How has the distribution of music and talk on the Danish
            Broadcasting Corporationâs radio channel P3 developed 1989-2019 by comparing a
          qualitative case study with a new large-scale study. Methodologically this shift from a
          close listening to a few programs to large-scale distant listening to more than 65,000
          hours of radio enables us to discuss and critically compare the methods, results,
          strengths and shortcomings of the two analysis. Previous studies have demonstrated that
          Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) trained for image recognition of spectograms of the
          audio outperforms alternative approaches, such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs). The
          large-scale study presented shows that the CNN-based approach generalizes well, even
          without fine-tuning, to speech and music classification in Danish radio, with an overall
          accuracy of 98%.

          Methods for Listening to Gentrification","Abstract
                [en]
        In this article, I outline a method of combining ethnography and computational soundscape
          analysis in order to listen to processes of gentrification in Washington, DC. I utilize
          Kaleidoscope Pro, a software suite built to visualize and cluster bioacoustic recordings
          (typically birds and bats) to cluster points of tension in the soundscape of Shaw, a
          rapidly gentrifying neighborhood in DC. Clustering and visualizing these sounds (which
          include car horns, sirens, public transportation, and music) makes audible the sonic
          markers of gentrification in Shaw. Furthermore, listening to gentrification is a call to
          engage with the sonic right to the city, histories of legislating sound, and sonorities of
          memory and nostalgia. This work contributes to the burgeoning black digital humanities
          canon by thinking through how computational methods can help us to hear black life.
          Although the digital humanities have turned to embrace the sonic in recent years, there is
          still much to be done in considering how to embrace the aural in DH work. This project
          invites us to listen closely to a changing neighborhood, and emphasizes sound as a valid
          mode of knowledge production, questioning how a sonic rendering of gentrifying space
          through the digital might move us toward more equitable soundscapes.

          Deep-Learning Pose Estimation across a Large Video Corpus","Abstract
                [en]
        The recent advent of deep learning-based pose detection methods that can reliably detect
          human body/limb positions from video frames, together with the online availability of
          massive digital video corpora, gives digital humanities researchers the ability to conduct
          ""distant viewing"" analyses of movement and particularly full-body choreography at much
          larger scales than previously feasible. These developments make possible innovative,
          revelatory digital cultural analytics work across many sources, from historical footage to
          contemporary images. They are also ideally suited to provide novel insight to the study of
          K-pop choreography. As a specifically non-textual modality, K-pop dance performances,
          particularly those of corporate and government-sponsored ""idol"" groups, are a key
          component of K-popâs core mission of projecting ""soft power"" into the international
          sphere. A related consequence of this strategy is the ready availability in online video
          repositories of many K-pop music videos, starting from the milieu's origins in the 1990s,
          including an ever-growing collection of official ""dance practice"" videos and
          fan-contributed dance cover videos and supercuts from live performancesâ . These latter
          videos are a direct consequence of the online propagation of the ""Korean wave"" by
          generations of tech-savvy fans on social media platforms.
        In this paper, we describe the considerations and choices made in the process of applying
          deep learning-based posed detection to a large corpus of K-pop music videos, and present
          the analytical methods we developed while focusing on a smaller subset of dance practice
          videos. A guiding principle for these efforts was to adopt techniques for characterizing,
          categorizing and comparing poses within and between videos, and for analyzing various
          qualities of motion as time-series data, that would be applicable to many kinds of
          movement choreography, rather than specific to K-pop dance. We conclude with case studies
          demonstrating how our methods contribute to the development of a typography of K-pop poses
          and sequences of poses (""moves"") that can facilitate a data-driven study of the
          constitutive interdependence of K-pop and other cultural genres. We also show how this
          work advances methods for ""distant"" analyses of dance performances and larger corpora,
          considering such criteria as repetitiveness and degree of synchronization, as well as more
          idiosyncratic measures such as the ""tightness"" of a group performance.

                [en]
        In this paper, we argue for the value of motion capture-driven research that moves
          audiovisual analysis in a performative direction to integrate the dancer/researcher into
          the cinematic space. Like the work of videographic practitioners who communicate their
          findings through the audiovisual medium, rather than the written medium, this work seeks
          to engage with what Catherine Grant and Brad Haseman have called performative research by
          applying a practice-led approach to moving image analysis. Through a physical and virtual
          embodiment of film and dance form, we seek to better understand the formal implications of
          danceâs integration into cinematic space and the material conditions that affected
          filmmakersâ narrative and stylistic choices. The Movement Visualization Tool (mv tool) is
          a virtual research environment that generates live feedback of multiple agentsâ movement.
          Accessible motion capture technology renders an abstracted skeleton of the moving agents,
          providing information about movement pathways through space using color-based and
          historical traceform filters. The tool can also replicate a mobile frame aesthetic,
          allowing for a constructed mover and a virtually constructed camera to engage in
          performative dialogue. We use the mv tool and videographic methods to recreate and
          disseminate two cases: movement scales from Laban/Bartenieff Movement Studies and dance
          sequences from narrative cinema. Rather than working from existing audiovisual content, we
          posit that the act of recreating the movement phrases leads to a deeper understanding of
          the choreography and, in the case of the filmic examples, of the formal practices that led
          to their creation.

        The annotation process of sign language corpora in terms of glosses, is a highly
          labor-intensive task, but a condition for a reliable quantitative analysis. During the
          annotation process the researcher typically defines the precise time slot in which a sign

          develop a set of tools to assist the annotation of the signs and their formal features in
          a video irrespectively of its content and quality. Recent advances in the field of deep
          learning have led to the development of accurate and fast pose estimation frameworks. In
          this study, such a framework (namely OpenPose) has been used to develop three different
          methods and tools to facilitate the annotation process. The first tool estimates the span
          of a sign sequence and creates empty slots in an annotation file. The second tool detects
          whether a sign is one- or two-handed. The last tool recognizes the different handshapes
          presented in a video sample. All tools can be easily re-trained to fit the needs of the
          researcher.

                    a Debate in Text Encoding","Abstract
                [en]
                Is hierarchical XML apt for the encoding of complex manuscript materials? Some
                    scholars have argued that texts are non-hierarchical entities and that XML
                    therefore is inadequate. This paper argues that the nature of text is such that
                    it supports both hierarchical and non-hierarchical representations. The paper
                    distinguishes (1) texts from documents and document carriers, (2) writing from
                    ""texting"", (3) actions that can be performed by one agent only from actions that
                    require at least two agents to come about (âshared actionsâ), (4) finite
                    actions from potentially infinitely ongoing actions. Texts are described as
                    potentially infinitely ongoing shared actions which are co-produced by author
                    and reader agents. This makes texts into entities that are more akin to events
                    than to objects or properties, and shows, moreover, that texts are dependent on
                    human understanding and thus mind-dependent entities. One consequence from this
                    is that text encoding needs to be recognized as an act participating in texting
                    which in turn makes hierarchical XML as apt a markup for âtext
                        representationâ, or rather: for texting, as non-hierarchical markup. The
                    encoding practices of the Bergen Wittgenstein Archives (WAB) serve as the main
                    touchstone for my discussion.

                 With suitable index structures many corpus exploration tasks can be solved in an
                    efficient way without rescanning the text repository in an online manner. In
                    this paper we show that symmetric compacted directed acyclic word graphs
                    (SCDAWGs) - a refinement of suffix trees - offer an ideal basis for corpus
                    exploration, helping to answer many of the questions raised in DH research in an
                    elegant way. From a simplified point of view, the advantages of SCDAWGs rely on
                    two properties. First, needing linear computation time, the index offers a joint
                    view on the similarities (in terms of common substrings) and differences between
                    all text. Second, structural regularities of the index help to mine interesting
                    portions of texts (such as phrases and concept names) and their relationship in
                    a language independent way without using prior linguistic knowledge. As a
                    demonstration of the power of these principles we look at text alignment, text
                    reuse in distinct texts or between distinct authors, automated detection of
                    concepts, temporal distribution of phrases in diachronic corpora, and related
                    problems.

                In this paper, we attack the problem of parsing name expressions and inferring
                    standard name form, gender and nobility status from serial historical sources.
                    This is a small but important part of modelling historiansâ analysis of such
                    sources, as they extract a lot of information from the names in text, and this
                    information constrain their search. The task of parsing proper names seems to be
                    easy, but it is a hard problem even for the modern languages, and even more
                    challenging for the languages of historical sources. The test case used for the
                    research was from the middle 19th century census for the old town centre of
                    Zagreb. In order to evaluate and compare the fitness of the probabilistic and
                    rule-based models for the task of inferring standard name form, both conditional
                    random field (CRF) and rule-based models based on stable model semantics (Answer
                    Set Programming Rules) were developed. Our results indicated that the rule-based
                    approach is more suitable for inferring standard name forms from historical
                    texts than the more widespread statistical approach.

               strategies, gender roles and conflicts between the mother-in-law and the the young
               30-something couple as protagonists. The article examines a scene in which the
               daughter confronts her mother's trauma-inducing behavior on her as a young girl, and
               the boyfriend confronts the mother-in-law's animosity toward him. The article delves

               by Margarete and Alexander Mitscherlich in the 1960s of politically salient post
               World War 2 trauma among a large variety of social groups in West (and East) Germany.
               The emotional repression as a result of various forms of guilt, which never
               explicitly surfaced in the confrontations, was passed down from generation to

            For the field of game history to mature, and for game studies more broadly to
               function in a scholarly manner in the coming decades, one necessity will be
               improvement of game citation practices. Current practices have some obvious problems,
               such as a lack of standardization even within the same journal or book series. But a
               more pressing problem is disguised by the fieldâs youth: Common citation practices
               depend on the play experiences and cultural knowledge of a generation of game studies
               scholars and readers who are largely old enough to have lived through the eras they
               are discussing. More sustainable and precise alternatives cannot fall back on the
               tools available for fixed media â such as the direct quotations and page numbers used
               for books or the screenshots (of images that appear to all viewers) and timecode used
               for video. Instead, this essay imagines an alternative approach, working in the
               digital humanities traditions of speculative collections and tool-based
               argumentation. In the speculative future we present, there are scholarly collections
               of software, as well as tools available for citing software states and integrating
               these citations into scholarly arguments. A working prototype of such a tool is
               presented, together with examples of scholarly use and the results of an evaluation
               of the concept with game scholars.

            Many tools can produce maps, graphs, and charts that may differ in seemingly minor
               ways. Data visualization tools are one type of âmiddlewareâ that can be all but forgotten when one is presented with final
               products such as papers and presentations containing visualizations . Since the output of various software packages is
               sometimes similar, it is easy to forget the assumptions that went into the diagram,
               the dataset, and the software when looking at the final product â or even while using
               the tool if one becomes sufficiently accustomed to the interface. In this review, I
               revisit the visualization suite Palladio â which Miriam Posner has called a âSwiss Army knife for humanities dataâ
                â and the many projects that have made use of Palladioâs
               core features in the years since its launch. I examine the strengths and limitations
               of Palladio, as a network and map-making tool for exploring data and for rapidly
               prototyping diagrams, designed with an iterative process in mind. I contrast this
               iterative mentality with the analytic sensibility of tools like Gephi and Cytoscape,
               and review the primary features of Palladio with one primary case study (my own
               visualizations of the French Enlightenment network) and examples of how the features
               have been used in other digital humanities projects. Palladio is very useful for
               qualitative studies of data that include geospatial and chronological dimensions,
               especially when the data are tagged with different types of qualitative metadata, but
               it also tends to impose a historical geographical view on the data by foregrounding
               geospatial relationships, time, and other historical considerations.

                It is difficult to discuss pre- and early post-European contact
                    life in the Caribbean. In part, this is due to the nature of European record
                    keeping, which often failed to fully capture Amerindian practices.
                    Archaeologists have long attempted to resolve these difficulties through the
                    analysis of early colonial Caribbean materials and objects that reflect both
                    Spanish and Amerindian influence. Through the use of computer modeling it is
                    possible to approach this issue from a new perspective, that of discerning
                    mainlandâisland or interâisland connections across the preâColumbian and
                    historic divide. Modeling hypothetical canoe routes based on the location of
                    inhabited sites (between 1000 AD â 1550 AD) across Trinidad and the mainland
                    coast of South America towards the Windward Islands can help to explore possible
                    avenues of travel that were changed or interrupted during the early colonial
                    period. This paper will approach this debate by looking for the location of
                    early colonial Amerindian sites and determining if connections between them
                    would reflect use of European influenced areas in this region.
            
        	Es difÃ­cil discutir la vida colonial en su etapa

                        registros europeos, que a menudo no lograron capturar completamente las
                        prÃ¡cticas amerindias. Los arqueÃ³logos han intentado durante mucho tiempo

                In 2010, the JosÃ© MarÃ­a Lafragua Historical Library (BenemÃ©rita Universidad
                    AutÃ³noma de Puebla) and the Franciscan Library (Universidad de las AmÃ©ricas
                    Puebla - Province of the Holy Gospel of Mexico) published the âCatÃ¡logo Colectivo de Marcas de Fuegoâ (CCMF). Marcas de fuego (fire brands) are burned imprints made
                    with a heated iron instrument that capture the distinctive seal of a bookâs
                    owner on one or several of the volumeâs edges. The use of marcas de fuego to claim ownership over books proliferated mainly
                    in conventual libraries during the Colonial period in Mexico.
                The first priority of CCMF was to go online with an initial selection of 120
                        marcas de fuego from various convents,
                    institutions, and individuals, in order to show the variety of provenance that
                    can be found in the print and manuscript collections of colonial libraries.
                    Arriving at this first stage of the project did not present exceptional
                    complications since it started as a collaboration between only two institutions.
                    As other libraries joined, however, it became necessary to work systematically
                    to standardize provenance as well as the names of authors. The complexities of
                    standardization and international collaboration are examined in this article, as
                    well as our experiences trying to make the catalog a reliable instrument for
                    other institutions that hold books that bear marcas de
                        fuego.
                This article considers the inception and development of the project to date,
                    looking in particular at the experience of coordinating the efforts of multiple
                    institutions in different countries. We offer this essay as a case study and
                    analysis that may serve for other similar projects, especially in Latin America.

               in bringing attention to this understudied corpus but has so far failed to attract

            This essay explores the challenges of using âthe digital,â both

               art. It argues that digital art history (DAH) tools and methods offer new ways to
               think about the non-neutrality of how we access, collect, and understand information
               discovered online. Specifically, it focuses on responses to a questionnaire and the
               development of a collaborative Omeka project (involving students) to consider how
               knowledge is produced in the digital environment. It reflects on issues of digital
               and visual epistemology, digital visuality, the ontology of art history,
               accessibility, and neocolonialism, and how these topics have been broached with

                There are hundreds of alphabetic texts in Zapotec languages dating back to the
                    16th century. Today, however, Zapotec speakers are generally unable to read
                    these texts, due to lack of access to the texts and an unfamiliarity with the
                    orthographic practices. Moreover, significant changes have taken place in the
                    grammar in the intervening centuries. This results in a situation where Zapotec
                    people may not have access to history in their own language. Ticha is an online
                    digital text explorer that provides access to images, transcriptions, analysis,
                    and translations of the Colonial Zapotec texts. The Ticha project includes
                    in-person workshops with Zapotec community members as part of an iterative
                    development process. Feedback from these interactions inform design decisions
                    for the project. Here we reflect on transnational collaboration with
                    stakeholders in building a digital scholarship project that seeks to use the
                    power of digital humanities to democratize access to materials and resources
                    which were previously the exclusive domain of a few experts. When community
                    members have access to important documents from their own history, archiving,
                    scholarship, and community engagement can be brought together in a powerful

                Resumen. Hay cientos de textos alfabÃ©ticos en lenguas zapotecas desde el siglo
                    diecisÃ©is. No obstante, hoy en dÃ­a los zapoteco-hablantes generalmente no pueden
                    leer estos textos, debido a una falta de acceso a los textos como tambiÃ©n por
                    falta de familiaridad con las prÃ¡cticas ortogrÃ¡ficas. AdemÃ¡s, la gramÃ¡tica ha
                    cambiado mucho en los siglos intermedios. Por consiguiente, muchos zapotecos no
                    tienen acceso a su historia escrita en su propia lengua. Ticha es un explorador
                    digital de texto que brinda acceso en lÃ­nea a las imÃ¡genes, transcripciones,
                    anÃ¡lisis y traducciones de los textos en zapoteco colonial. El proyecto de Ticha
                    incluye talleres con miembros de la comunidad zapoteca como parte de un proceso
                    de desarrollo interactivo. Los comentarios y reacciones que resultan de estas
                    interacciones informan las decisiones del diseÃ±o para el proyecto. AquÃ­
                    analizamos y reflexionamos sobre la colaboraciÃ³n transnacional con los
                        âstakeholdersâ en la construcciÃ³n de un proyecto digital

                    acceso a los materiales y recursos que previamente habÃ­an sido un dominio
                    exclusivo de unos pocos expertos. Cuando los miembros de la comunidad tienen
                    acceso a los documentos importantes de su propia historia, entonces el archivar,
                    la investigaciÃ³n, y el involucramiento con las comunidades pueden crear una

                        The 1920s and 1930s saw the rise of the city symphony, a film phenomenon
                              of experimental-documentary city films that took the modern metropolis
                              as their protagonist and presented it in its multiple facets and
                              kaleidoscopic nature. While Ruttmannâs Berlin. Die Sinfonie der
                                    Grosstadt (1927) and Vertovâs Chelovek s kinoapparatom (1929) gained canonical status
                              and exert a considerable influence on filmmaking to this very day, the
                              city symphony has remained a somewhat downplayed and neglected
                              phenomenon in film history. Indeed, besides the handful of well-known
                              titles, there have been more than eighty films made around the globe,
                              many of which fell into oblivion and have received little or no
                              scholarly attention at all. Moreover, even the canonical examples have
                              never systematically and structurally been analyzed in detail in a
                              comparative way. The result is the lack of a sophisticated and clear
                              definition of the city symphony, based on both the canonical films and
                              the greater city symphony corpus. My research sets in at this point,
                              addressing the conspicuous absence of an analysis of city symphony
                              characteristics. It does so by making use of a combined methodology of
                              traditional film analysis methods and digital tools. This article
                              reflects on the methodology applied and tools chosen and put into
                              practice to study and analyze the visual material of city symphonies,
                              which with their highly complex structure, dense imagery, and themes
                              as well as their experimental techniques and striking editing
                              patterns, are a perfect fit for a computational film analysis.

            This article presents a framework that reconciles the requirements of computational methods with a qualitative, phenomenological approach to the analysis of audiovisual media. In its temporality and multimodality we treat audiovisual media as exemplary with regard to the wider field of performative arts and their analysis in digital humanities approaches. 
               First, we argue in favor of grounding digital methodology explicitly in scholarly, theoretical approaches to the human experience of performative arts and outline a qualitative approach to compositional patterns and dynamics of affect in audio-visual media. To demonstrate this approach, an exemplary scene analysis highlights the specifics of analyzing experiential qualities based on micro-level descriptions of compositional structures.
               Eventually, the main body of the article spells out three central challenges with regard to this use of computational tools: 1.) recasting common film analytical vocabulary into a machine readable semantic ontology; 2.) setting up a systematic and applicable annotation routine that is based on the developed semantic ontology and allows for the interpersonal and consistent description of larger corpora; 3.) developing visualizations and query tools that enable the identification and tracing of compositional patterns within complex sets of annotation data.
               The article concludes by demonstrating the benefits of visualized annotation data by taking up the exemplary analysis sketched out earlier and, ultimately, reflects upon the implications of the outlined AdA filmontology as a programmatic starting point to addressing intersubjective bases of experience in the wider field of digital humanities.

                [en]
            
            In recent years, efforts to unlock digitized moving image collections have focused
               primarily on the retrieval of collection items through semantic descriptors: keywords
               or other labels produced either manually, or as (semi-)automatically generated
               metadata. As a result, access to digital archives is still governed overwhelmingly by
               a logic of search. In practice, this means that users not only need to know what they
               are looking for, but are also constrained by the interpretive frameworks informing
               the materialsâ labelling. Arguably, this poses restrictions on what they can find,
               how they can interrelate collection objects, and ultimately, how they can reuse or
               reinterpret collections. Taking such issues as its starting point, the Sensory Moving Image Archive project (SEMIA) investigated
               how visual analysis tools can help enable more exploratory forms of engaging with
               digital archives. In doing so, it focused on sensory features, which are essential to
               usersâ experiences of audiovisual heritage objects but inadequately captured by
               verbal description.
            In this article, we discuss the projectâs rationale and its early results. First, we
               place SEMIA in a recent history of visual analysis for media scholarly research,
               specifying how it both builds on and departs from this history (also in the epistemic
               sense). Subsequently, we provide more details about the projectâs approach to image
               feature extraction and discuss some analysis results. In our conclusions, we confront
               those results with what we had initially hoped to gain by applying computer vision
               methods for enabling access to collections.

            We examine film dialogue with quantitative textual analysis (stylometry, sentiment
               analysis, distant reading). Working with transcribed dialogue in almost 300
               productions, we explore the complex way in which most-frequent-words-based stylometry
               and lexicon-based sentiment analysis produce patterns of similarity and difference
               between screenwriters and/or a priori IMDB-defined genres. In fact, some of our
               results show that counting and comparing very frequent word lists reveals further
               similarities: of theme, implied audience, stylistic patternings. The results are
               encouraging enough to suggest that such quantitative approach to film dialogue may
               become a welcome addition to the arsenal of film studies methodology.

            Colors are one of the most difficult stylistic elements of film to analyze, but â as
               this paper elaborates â a most rewarding one too. A long-neglected topic in film
               studies, film colors have gained increasing attention over the last decade. With the
               development of database-driven analysis, deep-learning tools, and a large range of
               visualization methods the research project ERC Advanced Grant FilmColors set out to provide a more comprehensive approach to analyzing
               the manifold aspects of color in film. This paper focuses on a set of strong
               theoretical and analytical concepts of film colors â including human interpretation â
               that connect the stylistic, expressive, and narrative dimensions with the development
               and evaluation of digital methods. A corpus of more than 400 films have been analyzed
               with a computer-assisted workflow that has been integrated into the video annotation
               and analysis software VIAN since 2017. VIAN is connected to the online platform VIAN
               WebApp for the evaluation of results, queries, and visualizations on segment, film
               and corpus level. Compared to traditional, mostly language-dominated approaches to
               the aesthetics, technology, and narratology of film colors, the digital humanities
               tools turn evidence created through the mapping of results into an instantly
               accessible array of visual representations. By relating detailed human annotation and
               interpretation to these visual representations, the integrated workflow consisting of
               the VIAN visual analysis software in combination with the crowdsourcing portal VIAN
               WebApp has created a comprehensive ecosystem for the investigation of film aesthetics
               and narration. It thus significantly extends established methods in film studies.

                    placelessness and detachment from physical space and geographical location,
                    these matters still play a significant role in the way the digital humanities
                    research is practiced today, and also in the future. The location, the
                    surroundings and infrastructure open the questions of accessibility and
                    equality: space shapes the opportunities for doing digital humanities research,
                    both enables and hinders collaboration, and both unifies and divides
                    scholars.
                The purpose of this special issue is to examine the different aspects of situated research practices of the digital humanities
                    covering two perspectives: physical and virtual. The
                    physical places of research refer to the various digital humanities sites
                    (laboratories, centers, departments) all over the world and more widely to the
                    surroundings a location in a particular city, country, cultural sphere or
                    continent affecting research practices. As virtual environments of digital
                    humanities scholarship, we define the digital internet-based platforms,
                    services, and tools that enable research and scholarly collaboration. The
                    aspects that determine digital humanities research in both physical and virtual
                    places are infrastructure (material and non-material), social interaction
                    (communication and collaboration), and context (social, cultural, and political
                    situatedness). The aspects influence each other and changes in one of them can
                    affect the others. They have also impact on what is studied, the ways research
                    can be done, and, in the end the results of our knowledge, what kind of
                    knowledge digital humanities research can provide.

                                                laboratory as a physical place to
                                                conceptual laboratory. The last section
                                        analyses five models for humanities labs based on
                                        laboratoriesâ statements and operations: the center-type
                                        lab, the techno-science lab, the work station-type lab, the
                                        social challenges-centric lab, and virtual lab. The research
                                        shows that the laboratory turn has emerged in the humanities
                                        as a part of a wider process of the laboratorization of social life, which has
                                        been occurring since the 1980s. Next, the study indicates
                                        the role of digital humanities as the driving force behind
                                        building a laboratory space, which supports situated
                                        practices, the collaborative, and technology-based projects.
                                        The paper shows that the humanities lab does not simply
                                        imitate the science lab but adapts this new infrastructure
                                        for its own purposes and needs.

                This essay develops a conceptual framework for examining and practicing digital
                    humanities (DH) and DH labs from the perspective of science and technology
                    studies and laboratory studies. We argue that the
                        âsituatednessâ of DH labs extends beyond
                    physical/institutional space and includes also epistemic, political,
                    sociological, and disciplinary issues. To explore this, we first outline the
                    constructivist model of laboratory knowledge practices developed through
                    feminist laboratory studies, and how that modelâs focus on the laboratory as a
                    producer of research subjects, rather than a container for them, runs counter to
                    narratives about laboratories in DH. We then show how DH labs produce research
                    objects, research subjects, epistemic context, and disciplinary legitimacy.
                    Finally, we present the case of the Tactical Humanities Lab (THL) at Rensselaer,
                    a DH lab situated through Science & Technology Studies and housed within an
                    engineering-centered institute. Through the highlighting of two student-led
                    projects, we show how THL knowledge workers navigate issues of our own identity,
                    the boundaries of STS and DH, the practice of social justice through DH, and the
                    social construction of the boundaries of laboratory work.

                This article examines digital humanities (DH) centers as focal points of the
                    interdisciplinary transfer of knowledge. It is based on the assumption that the
                    manner in which the knowledge-transfer activities of DH communities are
                    facilitated affects the knowledge they produce. Following an analysis of eight
                    semi-structured interviews of directors, researchers, and administrators, the
                    article considers how DH professionals describe the facilitation of the
                    interdisciplinary transfer of knowledge in DH centers. It demonstrates that the
                    transfer of knowledge in DH centers is based on overlapping layers of organic
                    networks and stable organizational structures that support various kinds of
                    knowledge-sharing practices. The transfer of knowledge in DH centers combines
                    the exchange of ideas in the same physical space with online communication at
                    various levels, ranging from outside academia to the internal communication of a
                    research group. Further, the factors that enable information flow also have the
                    capability to restrict potentially meaningful information from entering into the
                    field. As a result, this article suggests that it is important to continue the
                    discussion on the boundaries for the transfer of knowledge in DH.

            In this paper I present Claude LÃ©vi-Straussâs Laboratoire
                  dâanthropologie sociale (LAS), established in 1960, as a case study of the
               archaeology of the humanities infrastructure. Building on media archaeology and
               critical infrastructure studies, I stress the significance of the research
               infrastructure in the analog humanities and I show how the LAS was organized around
               the Human Relations Area Files (HRAF), a vast ethnographical pre-electronic
               repository produced at Yale. The paper looks into how the Files were mobilized to secure funding and space for LÃ©vi-Straussâs lab
               and gain infrastructural advantage (boosted by the Filesâ paper-ness), helping it then to establish its position as ârichly
                  endowed.â As IÂ suggest, it might be due to these pragmatic considerations â not
               recognized as epistemically valid â that the Laboratory has not had any important
               place in the readings of LÃ©vi-Straussâs work. The paper also highlights âcare
                  workâ â taking care of resources and relocations â undertaken by LÃ©vi-Strauss
               and his collaborators. Finally, examining the rationale and history of the HRAF and
               looking at its use at the LAS, I demonstrate how the tool was refitted to serve the
               particular needs and ambitions of the Parisian lab.

                The computational tradition in India goes back to the two historic archival
                    projects Project Madurai, a digitised collection of ancient Tamil classics and
                    Bichitra, a digital variorum of Rabindranath Tagoreâs works which remarked the
                    genesis of Digital Humanities in India. Subsequently, few public and private
                    universities, non-academic organisations and individual scholars are actively
                    involved in digital humanities projects: digital library, digital archive and
                    digital databases. Though these digital establishments underpin Indian
                    humanities scholars to engage in digital humanities research practices, the

            In 2016, the Digital Matters Lab at the University of Utah launched a temporary
                  âpop-upâ space in the Marriott Library, the culmination of eighteen months of
               discussions between the College of Humanities, the College of Fine Arts, the College
               of Architecture+Planning, and the Marriott Library. After a previously unsuccessful
               attempt at creating a digital scholarship center in the late 2000s, our second
               attempt was rooted in skepticism. Why would this version be any more successful than
               the last? This paper chronicles how, learning from our mistakes, the Digital Matters
               Lab negotiated between a loose community of scholars and administrative stakeholders
               to navigate complex institutional legacies and bear a formal center with a
               cross-campus partnership, mission, and identity. The Labâs focus on environmental,
               financial, and technological sustainability emerged in response to the situated
               environment of Utah where water rights, public lands, and air quality are critical
               concerns. As a second iteration digital humanities/scholarship center, the Digital
               Matters Labâs emphasis on sustainability also reflects awareness of its vulnerability
               to the vicissitudes of administrative temperament or shifts in budgetary priorities.
               This case study concludes by looking to the future of the Digital Matters Lab in
               terms of scalability and permanence.

                The Digital Humanities and Literary Cognition (DHLC) lab at Michigan State
                    University was founded in 2012 with the mission of bringing together scholars
                    from disciplines including literature, neuroscience, education, computer
                    science, and digital humanities to investigate the cognitive processes involved
                    in reading texts of all kinds. The real story is much more complicated: emerging
                    through a combination of institutional risk-taking and serendipitous accident,
                    the lab was â and remains â an example of how conventional definitions of a
                        âlaboratory,â and particularly the rather fraught label
                    of âhumanities lab,â often come short of capturing the true
                    cross-disciplinary nature of this type of work. More than any academic or
                    methodological template, the DHLC lab emerged through the curiosity and
                    enthusiasm of the students who inhabit it. For that reason, this case study â a
                    brief history of the DHLCâs development, cultural practices, and ongoing work â
                    has been written collaboratively with multiple voices, including the lab
                    director (Natalie Phillips) and the student researchers. Together, we describe
                    the challenges and opportunities created by embarking on a radically
                    interdisciplinary research effort. We report the elements that enabled the DHLC
                    lab to find success through a willingness to abandon expectations and adapt to
                    rapidly evolving research practices, while maintaining our core focus on the
                    humanities. We hope this case study proves useful for those who, like us, seek
                    to explore the vast potential of interdisciplinary lab space for DH practice,
                    the pedagogical benefits of collaborative research, and how to prioritize

            How can practitioners outside of R-1s afford to build a DH lab? How to connect a
               labâs output to the communities it serves? This essay is a case study of Ooligan
               Press, a student-run trade press housed within a R-2, teaching-intensive university.
               Two elements make Ooligan Press distinctive as a DH lab. First, Ooligan is a
               not-for-profit business folded into a Masterâs program in Book Publishing. Profits
               from sale of Ooligan Press books sustain the lab, which would collapse if its books
               were steadily unprofitable. Second, the essay uses the DH feminism âM.E.A.L.S.â framework to explain how Ooligan's horizontal
               management structure and student ownership of the press manifest in an ethic of care.
               Unlike most R-1 DH labs, where priorities are set by senior scholars and directors,
               graduate students decide which projects the lab will develop, and which skills they
               want to master in exchange for their labor. Because Ooligan is self-sustaining, it
               can also be self-directing.

            The Old Books, New Science (OBNS) Lab began using Slack in May 2016 to facilitate the
               work of a diverse research group at the University of Toronto. Yet the OBNS Slack
               does not simply facilitate scholarly communication: it also serves as a powerful
               affective network, bringing together scholars in new and sometimes unexpected
               configurations. The affective language of emoji is fundamental to the growth of this
               community. Lab members coin new emoji that are taken up by the community eagerly,
               many of which are meaningful only within the OBNS environment. It is common to
               reference Slack emoji in in-person conversation; equally, the OBNS Slack is often
               home to advising sessions or meetings that in another workplace would take place
               face-to-face. In this way, the online environment of Slack and the in-person
               environment of the lab are mutually constitutive. Such usage of Slack may, however,
               also have a dark side: by celebrating affective community in the workspace, what
               happens to the distinction between home and office, and consequent erosion of leisure
               time? We consider whether the affective practices of the OBNS Slack might allow
               personal and professional boundaries to be blurred in such a way as to prioritize the
                  personal.

            How can digital traces of the performing arts be interpreted? What methodologies can
               be proposed to âmake them talkâ? The specificity of these traces
               leads to specific methodological responses, especially as the aim here is to
               interpret the traces in both directions of understanding and replayability. It is as
               much a question of advancing a reflection on the conditions for the recovery of work,
               as it is of analyzing an artistic approach based on its digital traces. Starting from
               these epistemological issues, I present the development of two softwares, Rekall and
               MemoRekall. These tools are part of a larger trend which I call âtheatre analyticsâ. Theatre analytics is based on data from the traces of
               the performing arts. Unlike the general approach of âbig data in the social
                  sciences and humanities,â where we seek to determine general, average, profile
               categories or repeatable (or even predictable) patterns, our primary concern remains
               to capture the singular, the detail, the difference, the anomaly, in a constant round
               trip between the micro and the macro dimensions. The ambition of theatre analytics is
               to offer a different way of looking at big data, more oriented towards complexity
               than the quantity of data.

            This paper presents a multicase study protocol for meta-research in Digital
               Humanities, prepared by Digital Methods and Practices Observatory (DiMPO) Working
               Group of the Digital Infrastructure for the Arts and Humanities in Europe (DARIAH).
               The protocol is intended to help researchers in conducting meta-research and adopting
               this methodology for different purposes, disciplines and approaches. As many of the
               issues raised here are already covered in manuals for social research, our focus is
               the specificity of meta-research in the DH environment. The specificity of DH in this
               respect relies on an intrinsic challenge of bringing together generally
               undertheorised approaches of the humanities with very formal and process-driven ICT
               approaches. 
            The main assumption behind this research is that a meaningful change in scholarly
               practices is taking place and is worth investigating. Moreover, a full assessment of
               this transformation should not focus exclusively on pioneering research, but rather
               on the selective uptake of digital practices and methods by researchers in the
               humanities: those who do not necessarily affiliate themselves with DH but simply use
               digital tools to explore particular problems. Hence, this paper should be of interest
               not only to researchers willing to conduct meta analysis, but to all DH practitioners
               willing to gain critical perspective on their work, as well as for those working on
               funding, evaluation and research policy.
            Three pilot studies are discussed in this paper, as they served as a basis for the
               protocol. They focused on different âunits of inquiryâ (individual researchers,
               projects, research communities) and varied in methodological directions: (a)
               individual interviews with Polish DH researchers; (b) mixed-methods analysis of
               digital practice in E-CURATORS, a multicase SSHRC Insight project focusing on
               archaeological research sites or projects, integrating individual interviews,
               document analysis and naturalistic observation; and, (c) group interviews with
               historians and literary scholars conducted within the framework of NEP4DISSENT COST
               Action. The resulting protocol is discussed in detail and some directions for further
               research are suggested.

                [en]
            
            This article proposes the concept of the pipeline as a category of tool that
               organizes a series of algorithms for users. The pipeline concept, adopted with
               limitations by the humanities, documents how a suite of algorithms produces a
               particular research result, with the goal of enabling interoperability, transparency,
               and iteration by future scholars who may switch out particular algorithms within the
               pipeline with different results. A pipeline-based application amplifies the concepts
               of interoperability and transparency for users by allowing the researcher to toggle
               on and off particular options, for example selecting and deselecting particular
               topics of interest from a program of visualizations based on a topic model of a large
               body of text. Pipelines support modular, interoperable, transparent, and documented
               processes of research that lend themselves to Prof. Guldi's Theory of Critical Search
               â the argument that critical thinking increasingly takes place at the design and
               research stage of digital processes. The article presents the case of how the
               pipeline concept influenced the development of HaToRI
               (Hansard Topic Relevance Identifier), an open-source pipeline-based tool for
               identifying a cohort of thematically-linked passages in the nineteenth-century
               debates of Britain's parliament. In our pipeline, a series of algorithms move through
               the steps of cleaning a corpus, organizing them into topics, and selecting particular
               topics that are used to extract a sub-corpus that matches the userâs interests. Users
               have the option of searching based on multiple topics rather than merely keywords or
               a single topic at a time, allowing iterative searches to build upon each other. As an
               example of the Critical Search process in action, we follow an inquiry based on
               matching parliamentary reports with material from the Hansard British Parliamentary
               Debates. Using the pipeline, the user is able to identify multiple common topics of
               interest, and from these topics, extract a sub-corpus specific to land use and rent
               in the 19th century British Empire.

            This article looks at online history projects focused on âlostâ spaces, with an
               emphasis on lost LGBTQ+ spaces. In documenting lost spaces, these projects also
               highlight lost or marginalized historical actors. I position these projects at the
               center of debates surrounding how to recover âlostâ peoples who have been left
               out or erased from mainstream histories. This article will discuss the various
               techniques used by digital humanities projects, focusing particularly on Jan Kurthâs
                  âLost Womynâs Spaceâ, Greggor Mattsonâs âMapping Lost Lesbian Barsâ, and my own project, âThe Feminist Restaurant Projectâ. This article discusses the
               various techniques used and the value these open access history websites serve for
               scholars and non-scholars alike. The article finishes by exploring how lost space
               projects preserve what was not previously preserved, while these websites are
               simultaneously vulnerable to similar preservation issues that plague digital
               humanities projects and community archives more broadly, especially those separate
               from large institutions. These challenges raise the questions: is lost space doomed
               to be lost? Can the history of LGBTQ+ space be recuperated? What role do digital
               humanities have in this work? And what does it mean to be found?

                        Thomisticus project through the tension between mechanical and human
                    labour. We propose that Busa and the IBM engineer Paul Tasman introduced two
                    major innovations that allowed computers to process unstructured text. The first
                    innovation was figuring out how represent unstructured text on punched cards,
                    the way data was encoded and handled at that time. The second innovation was
                    figuring out how to tokenize unstructured phrases on cards into words for
                    further counting, sorting and concording. We think-through these innovations
                    using replication as a form of media archaeology practice that can help us
                    understand the innovations as they were thought through at the time. All this is
                    framed by a letter found in the Busa archives criticizing the project as a
                        âtremendous mechanical labour ... of no great
                        utility.â We use this criticism to draw attention to the very
                    different meshing of human and mechanical labour developed at Busaâs concording

            We propose the philosophical notion of the fold as an evocative vocabulary for the
               design and critique of interactive data visualizations. An expanding range of
               application areas, such as digital art history and literary studies, illustrates the
               potential of data visualization for research and education in the humanities.
               Coinciding with the increasing currency of data as evidence in the humanities, this
               research addresses a growing interest in data visualization for visual analysis and
               argumentation. For example, cultural collection visualizations promise a range of
               possibilities for visual and interactive representations of digital cultural
               heritage, used both for free exploration and focused research. Based on the concept
               of the fold, prominently advanced by Gilles Deleuze, this paper outlines a critical
               framework that draws attention towards the complexity of the underlying data. The
               fold offers a way to analyze and conceptualize visualizations through the lens of
               three integrated operations: explication, implication, and complication. It is an
               opportunity to think of interactive visualizations as portals into coherent, elastic,
               and ultimately infinite information spaces. Accordingly, it rejects the separation
               between interactivity and visual encoding and draws attention to the transitions
               between multiple states of a visualization. We identify design patterns of the fold
               in data visualizations, devise a framework for the critical interpretation of
               interactivity in data visualization, and demonstrate the implications for the digital
               humanities.

            In this essay we explore the process of textual normalization in the context of
               machine-assisted collation, which is a common operation in digital textual
               scholarship. The Gothenburg modular architecture for computer-assisted collation
               situates normalization as the second stage within a five-stage computational
               pipeline, where it contributes to improving the eventual alignment. In this essay we
               argue that normalization, in fact, contributes not only to the alignment, but also to
               the interpretation of the texts. Furthermore, it occurs at several moments between
               transcription and rendering, and should not be regarded as happening all at once and
               only in one location.

                [en]
            
            Studies of video game narrative have long acknowledged that narrative in games is
               defined by interactivity â the playerâs ability to make different choices and produce
               various story endings. Recent ludonarrative scholarship on games and interactive
               storytelling has started to account for what this interactivity means for narrative
               form, yet it remains difficult to assess how variable narrative is in different
               games, or how different playersâ experiences with the same game can be. This article
               uses ImagePlot, software for visualizing large collections of images, to visualize
               playthroughs of a game and compare them. In doing so, it proposes a new method for
               analyzing narrative in games and digital media, and argues that games reveal how
               narrative form is shifting, emergent, and playful. By focusing on where and how
               narrative difference emerges, we can better understand how narrative constructs our
               current realities, and how it might contribute to different ones in the future.

                    		sharing and the freedom to produce and circulate that knowledge, if they

            Recent research shows the potentiality of applying Geographic Information Systems
               (GIS) in cultural and historical studies. These studies have proven the benefits,
               flexibility and also the difficulties that the use of this technology brings to the
               humanities area. In the researches developed in the field of heritage documentation,
               it was observed that most of them support and claim the advantages to carry out
               analyses with GIS but cannot reach them because they are restricted to using the
               technology only to geolocate certain information. This problem deserves special
               attention because it limits the generation of knowledge from the data collected and
               processed. This article proposes an example of a study that contemplates the
               digitalization and analysis phase of an important source of documentation and
               cartography of Spain: The Repertoire of all the ways of Spain in
                  the year of grace of 1546. The network of roads existing in the 16th
               century in the Iberian Peninsula was one of the main factors that helped the
               consolidation of commercial activities, the flow of knowledge and the constructive
               technical innovations in the new urban centres created. This paper proposes an
               analysis of the impact of these communication networks, through thematic maps,
               juxtaposition visualization, calculation of densities and calculation of the lowest
               cost path to study the terrestrial connections in the Peninsula. The result is a
               historical spatial data model capable of interrelating alphanumeric and/or
               physical-geographic data that enables a new perspective and source of information for
               researchers and professionals in different fields.

                As tecnologias digitais de difusÃ£o da informaÃ§Ã£o transformaram profundamente o
                    trabalho das Humanidades, que estÃ¡ hoje inscrito na lÃ³gica digital
                    de um modo muito mais profundo do que o rÃ³tulo  Humanidades
                        Digitais pode fazer crer â pois nÃ£o estamos diante do surgimento de
                    uma nova tendÃªncia, nem de uma nova linha de pesquisas, nem de um novo campo de
                    estudo no interior das Humanidades: estamos de fato diante de outras
                        Humanidades. Na raiz dessa transformaÃ§Ã£o estÃ¡ uma nova materialidade
                    do texto, que, como jÃ¡ discutiram PÃ©dauque (2004, 2006, 2007), Crane et al.
                    (2008), Gradmann & Meister (2008), Chaudiron et al. (2008), Baumann &
                    Crane (2010), e PaixÃ£o de Sousa (2013), modifica a condiÃ§Ã£o histÃ³rica do
                        documento â e, assim, instaura novas formas de leitura e novas
                    formas de ordenaÃ§Ã£o da leitura. Nesse sentido, sendo tarefas das Humanidades a
                    interpretaÃ§Ã£o do texto e a organizaÃ§Ã£o da sua transmissÃ£o social, essa nova
                    materialidade interpela diretamente os mÃ©todos, os horizontes epistemolÃ³gicos, e
                    a conformaÃ§Ã£o discursiva do campo. Neste artigo discutirei alguns dos efeitos
                    desse processo, fundada em uma abordagem conceitual da materialidade do texto
                    digital jÃ¡ proposta em PaixÃ£o de Sousa (2013), e inspirada na reflexÃ£o de
                    PÃªcheux (1992[1982]) sobre a leitura do arquivo e nas ideias de
                    Unsworth (2006) sobre as formas de atenÃ§Ã£o.
            
                This paper discusses the material conditions of digital text diffusion and its
                    effects for the Humanities, particularly as regards new forms of reading and new
                    forms in the ordination of reading. Observing the characteristic dispersion of
                    text in the digital medium, I investigate the forms of production and ordering
                    of digital texts from a material perspective, pointing out the inclusion of an
                    artificial logical stage in the text diffusion process as the fundamental
                    singularity of this medium (based on proposals already outlined in PaixÃ£o de
                    Sousa, 2017). This contingency allows us to consider digital text diffusion as a
                    radically new stage in the history of writing and reading, in a similar sense as
                    pointed out by PÃ©dauque (2004, 2006, 2007); Crane et al. (2008,) Gradmann &
                    Meister (2008), Chaudiron et al. (2008), and Baumann & Crane (2010). Rested on
                    the concept of âforms of attentionâ in Unsworth (2006), I also suggest that, in
                    shaping new forms of reading, this change in the material character of the text
                    profoundly alters traditional work in the Humanities, and establishes a new
                    discursive conformation for the field. Finally, I argue that this new condition
                    deserves critical consideration in all different areas of the Humanities, but
                    particularly in those that take the âtextâ as their central object of
                    attention.

            Introduction - Regarding the concerns that prompted the emergence of digital
               curation, this study takes as an example the context of the production of large
               volumes of scientific information, which requires approaches that ensure its
               maintenance, reuse and valorization, considering its cost.
            Objectives - It is intended to discuss the relevant issues regarding the costs of
               digital curation and to develop a framework model proposal for the analysis of costs
               in digital curation, including projects of a more practical nature. This means
               addressing the concept definition and the issue of costs, based on studies related to
               cost models. 
            Methodology - A literature review was carried out, contextualizing the issue of costs
               within digital curation, with data collected from Biblioteca do
                  Conhecimento Online â B-On (Online Knowledge Library) and RepositÃ³rios CientÃ­ficos de Acesso Aberto de Portugal â
               RCAAP (Scientific Open Access Repository of Portugal) as research literature sources.
               Then, a framework model scheme was developed based on the categories identified using
               the Constant Comparative Method, some related to the Open
                  Archival Information System (OAIS) Reference Model and to the Digital Curation Centre (DCC) Life Cycle. This allowed the
               development of a content analysis of the perceptions collected from different
               authors, resulting in memos, of which this text is a summary.
            Results / Conclusion - It is proposed a systematization of digital curation issues,

            This paper addresses the experience of the author when developing a digital platform
               on the history of nature conservation in California from 1848. This digital platform
               is designed to showcase, allow exploration and knowledge transfer as well as ask new
               questions and place new hypotheses on the history of conservation, for a state
               pioneer in these themes. The natural resource values of California along with the
               entrepreneurship allowed for an early start of nature conservation in the state.
               These ideas of conservation soon were brought into legislation, governmental action
               and processes, and population awareness and behavior. However, the development of the
               conservation history was not without barriers, as nature conservation has been
               challenged by development processes, namely exponential population growth and urban
               fabric, and the growing need for land use management that met the needs from
               different sectors. The Project herein described is based on the need to showcase the
               history of conservation in California, visualize its development over time, and
               analyze socio-economic and environmental drivers of its development over the last
               160 years. This article is therefore of importance as it contributes to broadening and
               deepening the discussion along the challenges brought about by urban and population
               development. The digital platform described herein is therefore innovative and
               fundamental to further stimulate new questions at the interface of history and many
               other disciplines.

                Digital editions are easily modified after they are first published â a state of
                    affairs that poses challenges both for long-term scholarly reference and for
                    various forms of electronic distribution and analysis. This article argues that
                    producers of digital editions should assign meaningful version numbers to their
                    editions and update those version numbers with each change, allowing both humans
                    and computers to know when resources have been modified and how significant the
                    changes are. As an examination of versioning practices in the software industry
                    reveals, version numbers are not neutral descriptors but social products
                    intended for use in specific contexts, and the producers of digital editions
                    must consider how version numbers will be used in developing numbering schemes.
                    It may be beneficial to version different parts of an edition separately, and in
                    particular to version the data objects or content of an edition independently
                    from the environment in which it is displayed. The article concludes with a case
                    study of the development of a versioning policy for the Piers Plowman Electronic Archive, and includes an appendix
                    surveying how a selection of digital editions handle the problem of recording
                    and communicating changes.

                In spite of the increasingly large textual datasets humanities researchers are
                    confronted with, and the need for automatic tools to extract information from
                    them, we observe a lack of communication and diverging goals between the

                    This contrasts with the wealth of potential opportunities that could arise from
                    closer collaborations. We argue that more efforts are needed to make NLP tools
                    work for DH datasets so that that NLP research applied to humanities data
                    receives more attention, leading to the development of evaluation approaches
                    tailored towards relevant research questions. This has the potential to bring

                [en]
				
				Historians have regularly debated whether advertisements can be used as a viable source
					to study the past. One of their main concerns centered on the question of agency.
					Were advertisements a reflection of historical events and societal debates, or were
					ad makers instrumental in shaping society and the ways people interacted with
					consumer goods? Using techniques from econometrics (Granger causality test) and
					complexity science (Adaptive Fractal Analysis), this paper analyzes to what extent
					advertisements shaped or reflected society. We found
					evidence that indicates a fundamental difference between the dynamic behavior of word
					use in articles and advertisements published in a century of Dutch newspapers.
					Articles exhibit persistent trends. Contrary to this, advertisements have a more
					irregular behavior characterized by short bursts and fast decay, which, in part,
					mirrors the dynamic through which advertisers introduced terms into public discourse.
					On the issue of whether advertisements shaped or reflected society, we found
					particular product types that seemed to be collectively driven by a Granger causality
					going from advertisements to articles. Generally, we found support for a complex
					interaction pattern, analogous to Cowanâs concept of the consumption junction.
					Finally, we discovered noteworthy patterns in terms of Granger causality and
					long-range dependencies for specific product groups. All in, this study shows how
					methods from econometrics and complexity science can be applied to humanities data to
					improve our understanding of complex cultural-historical phenomena such as the role
					of advertising in society.

                Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on contemporary and historical data is still
                    in the focus of many researchers. Especially historical prints require book
                    specific trained OCR models to achieve applicable results 
                    . To reduce the human effort for manually annotating
                    ground truth (GT) various techniques such as voting and pretraining have shown
                    to be very efficient 
                    . Calamari is a new open source OCR line recognition
                    software that both uses state-of-the art Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) implemented
                    in Tensorflow and giving native support for techniques such as pretraining and
                    voting. The customizable network architectures constructed of Convolutional
                    Neural Networks (CNNS) and Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) layers are trained by
                    the so-called Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) algorithm of Graves et
                    al. (2006). Optional usage of a GPU drastically reduces the computation times
                    for both training and prediction. We use two different datasets to compare the
                    performance of Calamari to OCRopy, OCRopus3, and Tesseract 4. Calamari reaches a
                    Character Error Rate (CER) of 0.11% on the UW3 dataset written in modern English
                    and 0.18% on the DTA19 dataset written in German Fraktur, which considerably

                    can be used and reused for various types of computational analysis. Scholars

                The Digital Prosopography of the Roman Republic (DPRR) project has created a
                    freely available structured prosopography of people from the Roman Republic. As
                    a part of this work the materials that were produced by the project have been
                    made available as Linked Open Data (LOD): translated into RDF, and served
                    through an RDF Server. This article explains what it means to present the
                    material as Linked Open Data by means of working, interactive examples. DPRR
                    didn't do some of the work which has been conventionally associated with Linked
                    Open Data. However, by considering the two conceptions of the Semantic Web and
                    Linked Open Data as proposed by Tim Berners-Lee one can see how DPRR's RDF
                    Server fits best into the LOD picture, including how it might serve to
                    facilitate new ways to explore its material. The article gives several examples
                    of ways of exploiting DPRR's RDF dataset, and other similarly structured
                    materials, to enable new research approaches.

                    classroom culminating in a digital mapping project. Lacking explicit previous
                    training in DH, faculty drew on second language (L2) pedagogy, new literacies,
                    and DH pedagogy to develop an inclusive approach to course design and

                    traveling players' Fortunatus, with a quite
                    complex history of circulation and performance and a vast network of sources and
                    influences. Since the traveling theater was contingent (context-based) and
                    extemporaneous, the associated playtexts, collaborative adaptations and
                    translations of English works, present unique challenges for editors and
                    scholars. In fact, their printed form often misrepresents the kind of theater
                    practiced. I raise the question of how the textual remnants of this theater
                    shaped critical attitudes regarding the travelers, and I suggest that
                    capabilities of digital publication can illuminate the episodic and modular
                    characteristics of early modern performance.

                    discusses concerns over the power of metadata, the need for transparent and

                    responsibilities to accurately categorize scholarsâ work. It particularly
                    focuses on the potentially disproportionate harm done to traditionally
                    marginalized fields of study through seemingly racist or sexist topical labeling
                    that impedes knowledge discovery.

                The Palatine Anthology (PA) Project, coordinated by the Canada Research Chair on
                    digital textualities directed by Marcello Vitali-Rosati, collaborates with
                    several international partners, including Italian and French schools, in order
                    to establish a collaborative critical digital edition and a multilingual
                    translation of all the PA's epigrams. In particular, our project aims to further
                    develop this edition of the PA, thereby demonstrating the philological,
                    editorial and pedagogic challenges involved in compiling the diverse fragments
                    of this collection of Greek epigrams. Since its discovery in 1606 by Claude
                    Saumaise in the Palatina Library of Heidelberg in Germany , the PA manuscript (Codex Palatinus 23) has
                    considerably influenced literature and art. As we know it today, the Anthology
                    is the result of successive compilations, modifications, additions, and
                    rearrangements by the compilers. Meleager's collection is a collection of
                    epigrams compiled in the first century B.C., which represents the original
                    source of what is known today as the Greek Anthology . This collection, called The
                        Garland, was not randomly arranged, but according to a series of
                    particular organizational principles . 
                 The PA challenges the concept of an âoeuvreâ â as a unified
                    and cohesive body of work â, insofar as it brings together 4Â 000 epigrams
                    written by more than one hundred different authors from over sixteen centuries
                    of literary production (from the Byzantine empire to the 10th century AD). If we cannot consider the Anthology
                    as a unified and cohesive work, how do we account for it in an edition? To these
                    questions, the digital environment presents tools and possibilities allowing us
                    to organize our research, and ultimately work towards finding some answers. In
                    an attempt to provide tangible solutions to the difficulty of assembling such a
                    fragmented body of work the PA Project harnesses digital tools. We have created
                    an open database searchable via an API that allows one to transcribe the
                    manuscript, propose translations, align translations, transcribe scholia, and
                    link epigrams both to each other and to external literary and artistic
                    references. We aim to demonstrate the importance of philological approaches to
                    texts; redefine the boundaries between scholarly and amateur practices; connect
                    contemporary readers and scholars with Classical texts; supplement the Perseus
                    project; and harness the potential of semantic web technologies. We aim to shed
                    light on the many ways to engage with textual objects, to conceive of a multiple
                    reception of the anthological imaginary . The
                    interface of our digital platform does intend for users to propose such reading
                    pathways and weak ties
                    , because it enables them to associate an
                    epigram with a reference (textual, iconographic, musical, cinematographic, and
                    others) and thereby demonstrate a collective engagement with the epigram . This demonstrates how collective imaginaries are able
                    to enrich our understanding of the anthological material. By enabling the users
                    to engage with this otherwise elusive literary object, the Greek epigrams, and
                    with a cultural object, our project enables contemporary readers to engage with
                    the digital possibilities in order to visualize a collective imaginary or topoÃ¯
                        , and to contribute to philological research on the
                    origins and influences of the PA .

                In this study, we present the first large-scale quantitative analysis of a corpus
                    of censored historical Hebrew manuscripts that have survived through the ages. A
                    new multi-dimensional ontology-based approach was applied to explore the
                    geographic, temporal, actor- and subject-based distribution of censorship
                    events. We adopted an ontology-based approach to apply statistical analysis on
                    the metadata of censored Hebrew manuscripts for estimating the scope and
                    quantifying the extent of the known facts on the censorship activity and its
                    various characteristics over the years. In addition, we revealed some previously
                    unknown phenomena and trends. Particularly, we analysed the relationship of
                    censorship on other types of events in manuscriptsâ lifecycle and compared the
                    distribution of censored vs. non-censored manuscripts in different dimensions.
                    We also devised a set of rules to complete the missing locations of over 50% of
                    censorship events, which has substantially changed the big picture of spatial
                    distribution of censorship activity. From the temporal perspective our findings
                    demonstrate that censorship was conducted in âwavesâ and there was a
                    decrease in the creation of new manuscripts in periods of high censorship
                    activity. Certain subjects, such as Kabbalah and Philosophy were censored
                    significantly more than others, and the locations and script typesâ distribution
                    in censored manuscripts differs from the non-censored manuscripts.

                Semantic Web technologies provide the ability to more effectively connect and
                    integrate structured data by disclosing their intended meaning and therefore
                    making explicit their description, context and provenance. Thanks to their
                    nature, Semantic Web technologies have produced insights into the challenges
                    associated with standardizing metadata for manuscripts. Scholars depend on
                    highly specific catalogue records in order to understand a manuscript and raise
                    research questions which take into account either its physicality or its nature
                    of âevidence for all aspects of
                            life in the medieval periodâ.
                    However, the heterogeneity of codicological-paleographical records in terms of
                    metadata and terminology is weakening the integration and interoperability
                    within the community. Ontologies in particular have been evaluated as a clever
                    approach towards a better communication.
                The employment of knowledge representation in the field of medieval manuscript
                    descriptions is still narrow, though. Against the state of the art, this paper
                    attempts to add some evidence: it analyses the impact of a top-level ontology
                    designed for modelling cultural objects, namely CIDOC
                        Conceptual Reference Model, on a set of fifteen Italian manuscript
                    descriptions encoded in TEI standard using the
                    online platform ManusOnLine. In this case study,
                    the semantics underlying the selected TEI
                    XML-encoded manuscript descriptions were visually explored according to
                    a subset of CIDOC CRMâs classes and properties. In
                    doing so, the process of the creation of a manuscript was split and analysed in
                    its internal phases in accordance with the CIDOC
                        CRM event-modelling principle. Within the dataset, tags as
                    <date> and <name> are used sporadically to encode factual
                    information; however, this case study shows that events and relations can be
                    generally deduced from the XML structure of a
                    manuscript description, although they are not expressively identified. Overall,
                    the analysis demonstrates that CIDOC CRM can
                    represent a valuable aid to overcome manuscripts-related issues â i.e.
                    granularity, contradictory knowledge and terminology â and potentially create an
                    interlinked data platform which could greatly enhance the study of human
                    culture.

                Skillful identification and interpretation of arguments is a cornerstone of
                    learning, scholarly activity and thoughtful civic engagement. These are
                    difficult skills for people to learn, and they are beyond the reach of current
                    computational methods from artificial intelligence and machine learning, despite
                    hype suggesting the contrary. In previous work, we have attempted to build
                    systems that scaffold these skills in people. In this paper we reflect on the
                    difficulties posed by this work, and we argue that it is a serious challenge
                    which ought to be taken up within the digital humanities and related efforts to
                    computationally support scholarly practice. Network analysis, bibliometrics, and
                    stylometrics, essentially leave out the fundamental humanistic skill of
                    charitable argument interpretation because they touch very little on the
                        meanings embedded in texts. We present a problematisation of

                    the nature and form of arguments in historical texts gained from our attempt to

                The present paper addresses the problem of literary history as a problem of data
                    comprehensiveness and selection, seeking not to resolve the impossibility of
                    literary historical narrative, but to reframe it through a computational
                    perspective. Our focus is on the Quan Tang
                        shi
                    å¨åè©© (Complete Tang poetry), the
                    massive comprehensive anthology of Tang poetry that was produced at the height
                    of the Qing dynasty (1644â1912). The sheer quantity of Tang poetry preserved in
                    the Quan Tang shi (over 50,000 poems
                    and poem fragments) exceeds the human-scale perspectives of close reading. To
                    make sense of the corpus as a whole, we will show how two related forms of
                    distant reading â topic modeling and divergence measures â allow us to reframe and
                    rethink these literary historical questions and provide a new perspective on
                    what it means to read Tang poetry.

                [en]
                With The Library of Digital Latin Texts (LDLT), the
                    Digital Latin Library (DLL) is set to publish critical editions as sets of data
                    independent of a presentational format. These datasets are meant to be reused
                    for a variety of purposes and in a variety of presentational formats, including
                    the DLLâs own user edition viewer and data visualization applications. It is
                    thus vital to have a way of certifying the data as published in accordance with
                    the DLLâs policies and procedures, central to which are its provisions for peer
                    review. Accordingly, to facilitate the use of an editionâs data in different
                    settings, and to promote a high degree of confidence in the quality of the data,
                    we have introduced the DLL Review Registry Service. The DLL Review Registry
                    Service offers a way of associating peer reviewed status with the text data
                    rather than within any particularly visualization of that data. Any
                    visualization of text data can consult this service and discover whether or not
                    this data has been reviewed. In this way, we free the âimprimaturâ from its
                    association with any particular presentation and allow the indicators of quality

                To examine changes in the diversity of popular songs over time, I have analyzed
                    the lyrics of 99% of all songs sung in English that have appeared on the U.S.
                    Billboard Hot 100 chart from 1956 up to and including 2016 (n=27.108). I have
                    found the number of songs that reached the Hot 100 per year more than halved
                    between 1966 and 2002, which indicates a loss in diversity. I have also found
                    that the variation of valence (or level of pleasantness) in the
                    songsâ lyrics and the variation of a sampled Type Token ratio (an indicator for
                    lexical complexity) decreases over time. This indicates that lyrics of popular
                    songs become more similar and again signify a loss of diversity.

                    using survey responses from more than 500 scholars, librarians, and archivists.
                    Questions sought to determine the extent to which these groups collaborate with
                    one another on project teams; how these collaborations unfold and who initiates
                    them; whether IPs have begun to adjust and adapt their work to support specific

               Humanities-project BRIDGE. The project developed and tested methods for automatically
               creating meaningful links and expanding archival television data. In the project, a
               high level of collaboration was required between scholars from two different
               disciplines: computer sciences and media studies. The majority of the epistemological
               encounters between the two disciplines took place in the design of the developed
               tools and the user studies to test the tools. The article is based on structured
               conversations between the two central staff members in the project, i.e. the computer
               science PhD-student and the media studies postdoctoral researcher. By unravelling the

                We present findings from interdisciplinary research at the intersection between
                    literary studies, information visualization, and interface design. Despite a
                    growing interest in text visualization among literary scholars, so far,
                    narrative visualizations are not designed to support the particular tasks
                    involved in narratological analysis and often fail to reveal nuanced
                    narratological features. One major outcome of our iterative research and design
                    process is Narrelations, a novel visualization technique specifically suited for
                    analyzing and interpreting narrative levels of a story and temporal aspects of
                    its narrative representation. The visualization provides an overview of the
                    nesting and distribution of narrative levels, integrates the representation of
                    temporal phenomena, and facilitates the examination of correlations between
                    these aspects. With this research we explore how collaboratively designed visual
                    encodings and interaction techniques may allow for an insightful analysis at a
                    high level coupled with a close inspection of text passages. We discuss prior
                    work relevant to our research objectives and explain the specific
                    characteristics of narrative levels and temporal aspects of narrative
                    representation. After describing the research process and design principles, we
                    apply the visualization on a test corpus of eight annotated German short stories
                    and demonstrate its heuristic value for literary analyses and interpretations.
                    In particular, we explore the intricate connections between the literary content
                    of the novellas and their narrative form.

                This article articulates a digital adaptation of enumerative bibliography and
                    argues for its recuperative potential in feminist literary history. Digital
                    enumerative bibliography uses bibliographical structures within a relational
                    database that allows researchers to track more relevant metadata such as
                    geographical location of subject matter, language, and time period. Whereas
                    traditional enumerative bibliographies use a hierarchy of textual data, a
                    relational database creates a nexus that facilitates new kinds of research
                    queries. As an example, we offer our digital project the Women in Book History Bibliography and use its 1,550 citations as a
                    dataset to trace what is womenâs book history. We then advocate for digital
                    enumerative bibliography as a form of feminist recovery efforts that recovers
                    not only primary texts but scholarship about them.

                    activism and how we frame its histories. Relying primarily on examples from
                    Caribbean-oriented digital work, the author argues for a broad definition of DH
                    activism that allows for a variety of projects and intended audiences. In
                    particular, the essay responds to the tendency to focus on âDH in the
                        momentâ (projects that can be done quickly and yield a high social
                    impact) as the primary form of activism, arguing that alongside such projects we
                    include as activist projects that have a more cumulative and less immediate
                    effect. Recently, we have begun to ask not just what the digital humanities
                    does, but what the digital humanities does for others. This essay considers why
                    it is that this has become a key question in this DH moment.

                [en]
                Our libraries are full of manuscripts, many of them modern. However, the
                    digitisation of these unique documents is currently very expensive. How can
                    we reduce the cost of encoding them in a way that will facilitate their
                    study, annotation, searching, sharing, editing, comparison and reading over
                    the Web? Unlike new documents prepared for the Web, historical manuscripts
                    frequently contain internal variation in the form of erasures, insertions,
                    substitutions and transpositions. Variation is also often expressed
                    externally between copies of one work: in successive print editions, in
                    manuscript copies or successive drafts. Current practice is to prepare
                    separate transcriptions of each physical document and to embed internal
                    variation directly into the transcribed text using complex markup codes.
                    This makes the transcriptions expensive to produce and hard to edit, limits
                    text reuse and requires that transcriptions be first disentangled via
                    customised software for reading, searching, or comparison.
                An alternative approach, described here, is to separate out the internal
                    variation of each document into notional layers. This is done primarily in
                    order to facilitate the recording of revisions at any one point. The move
                    is, of course, counter-intuitive since these document-wide layers were not
                    intended by the author as texts to be read. But it proves itself in practice
                    by radically simplifying the tasks of editing, searching and comparison.
                    Versions, on the other hand, are higher-level constructs that do represent
                    the state of a text as it was left at some point in time by an author or
                    scribe.
                By employing layers to record complex revisions, the task of computing
                    differences among intra-document layers and against versions of the same
                    work in multiple documents may be delegated to the machine rather than
                    having to be recorded laboriously by hand. The ensuing simplification of
                    markup reduces transcription and editing costs, boosts text reuse and
                    searching, and, by removing the need for customised software, increases the
                    longevity of digital transcriptions.

                This article offers a methodological contribution to manually-assisted topic
                    modeling. With the availability of vast amounts of (online) texts, performing
                    full scale literary analysis using a close reading approach is not practically
                    feasible. The set of alternatives proposed by Franco Moretti (2000) under the
                    umbrella term of âdistant readingâ aims to show broad patterns that can be
                    found throughout the entire text collection. After a survey of literary-critical
                    practices that combine close and distant reading methods, we use manual
                    annotations of a thread on Reddit, both to evaluate an LDA model, and to provide
                    information that topic modeling lacks. We also make a case for applying these
                    reading techniques that originate in literary reading more broadly to online,
                    non-literary contexts. Given a large collection of posts from a Reddit thread,
                    we compare a manual, close reading analysis against an automatic, computational
                    distant reading approach based on topic modeling using LDA. For each text in the
                    collection, we label the contents, effectively clustering related texts. Next,
                    we evaluate the similarity of the respective outcomes of the two approaches. Our
                    results show that the computational content/topic-based labeling partially
                    overlaps with the manual annotation. However, the close reading approach not
                    only identifies texts with similar content, but also those with similar
                    function. The differences in annotation approaches require rethinking the
                    purpose of computational techniques in reading analysis. Thus, we present a
                    model that could be valuable for scholars who have a small amount of manual
                    annotation that could be used to tune an unsupervised model of a larger
                    dataset.

                    infectious fungi and cancer cells, we forge a connection in color, composition,
                    and theme between Paolo Veroneseâs Les Noces de
                        Cana and Paul CÃ©zanneâs Baigneuse debout,
                        sâessuyant les cheveux. From this connection, we bring to light a
                        âhiddenâ compositional structure, heretofore
                    unidentified, in CÃ©zanneâs Bathers as a series. Using computer-assisted systems
                    such as DIAS and DENDRON allowed us to detect relatedness in these paintings not
                    necessarily visible to the human eye. With DIAS and DENDRON, we generated
                    dendrograms that clustered paintings related in brightness, saturation,
                    complexity, and color. After studying color, we applied DIAS to the study of
                    CÃ©zanneâs composition. Because CÃ©zanne expressed Neoplatonic ideals regarding
                    paintings in his conversations and letters, we programmed DIAS to compute axial
                    lines and âgolden sectionsâ according to the dimensions of
                    the square or rectangular painting under scrutiny. Using DIAS we identified the
                    golden rectangle for Veroneseâs Les Noces de Cana,
                    CÃ©zanneâs Baigneuse debout, sâessuyant les cheveux
                    and Ingresâ La Source (another likely model for
                        Baigneuse debout, sâessuyant les cheveux). From
                    the similarities and differences between the three paintings we identified,
                    regarding their use of axial symmetry and the golden section, we have formulated
                    a new approach to âseeingâ CÃ©zanneâs composition in his
                    Bather series. Â  CÃ©zanneâs noumenal bodies, formerly perceived as
                        âawkwardâ and composed with âbaffling
                        imbalance,â we can now see as âgolden.â

                Academic libraries have an important role to play in supporting digital
                    humanities projects in their communities. Librarians at Stony Brook University
                    Libraries host Open Mic events for digital humanities researchers, teachers, and
                    students on campus. Â Inspired by a desire to better serve digital humanists with
                    existing projects, this event was initially organized to increase the visibility
                    of scholars and students with nascent projects and connect these digital
                    humanists to library supported resources and to one another. For the Libraries,
                    the Open Mic was an opportunity to understand the scope and practices of the
                    digital humanities community at Stony Brook, and to identify ways to make
                    meaningful interventions. Â  An open mic is a uniquely suitable event format in
                    that it embodies a dynamic, permissive, multidisciplinary presentation space
                    that is as much for exercising new and ongoing research (and technologies) as it
                    is for making discoveries and connections. Â The success of these events can be
                    measured in the establishment of the University Libraries as a nexus for digital
                    humanities work, consultations, instruction, workshops, and community on a
                    campus without a designated digital humanities center. Â  The digital humanities
                    Open Mic event at Stony Brook University locates the digital humanities within
                    the libraryâs repertoire, while signaling that the library is â in a number of
                    essential ways â open.

                This article illuminates the ways that digital humanities labs might foster
                    experiences for graduate students that fulfill what Alexander Reid (2002)
                    postulates as the âcentral taskâ of the digital
                    humanities graduate education. We argue that while the digital humanities lab as
                    an institutional economic model does not necessarily promote a focus on graduate
                    student professionalization, it uniquely has the capacity to push back against
                    competing discourses of neoliberal vocationalism, funding and labor precarity on
                    one hand, and technological utopianism and tool fetishization on the other, to
                    train students agile, contextual, and rhetorical mindsets with which to enter
                    technologically-mediated workplaces and lives. To begin, we review the
                    discussion of digital humanities labs in the literature: digital humanities
                    institutional models, how these models are practiced, lab funding, and the
                    resultant position of labs as sites of training for graduate students. From
                    there, we offer a teaching case from the Labâs fall 2015 âStories from Dataâ
                    workshop in order to render visible a set of principles to guide
                    professionalization of graduate students in the digital humanities lab. We
                    conclude with reflections on how these principles might alter current
                    discussions of the success or failure of the Mellon Foundation and NEH ODH

                This essay responds to two questions at the heart of the Invisible Labor in the
                    Digital Humanities 2016 symposium at Florida State University: (1) what is at
                    stake in making unseen work visible, and (2) how can DH projects equally
                    distribute and value the labor involved in their construction? For us, the
                    answer to these questions lies in privileging the pedagogical affordances of
                    data construction by crafting a workflow that included undergraduates as
                    intellectual partners, and using DH methods to visualize and make public this
                    collaborative labor. By drawing on our work with Photogrammar, which visualizes
                    federal New Deal documentary projects including photography and life histories,
                    we highlight three strategies for making labor visible in the digital
                    humanities. First, we discuss how this project served as a tool for teaching
                    undergraduate students key methods in DH by giving them experience with
                    conducting original research with credit on the public site. In this way, we
                    explain how pedagogy can become a part of project development. Second, we argue
                    that DH visualization techniques can make the labor behind DH projects visible.
                    We focus on how Photogrammar uses a timeline and network analysis alongside the
                    traditional âAboutâ page to make visible all
                    participants in the project. Third, we turn to an open discussion of the
                    challenges faced in the politics of attribution when working with university,
                    governmental and private historical organizations, including domain names and
                    the use of organizational logos.

                This short essay describes the difficulties and impromptu workarounds that
                    emerged when using the video game âMinecraftâ as the
                    central teaching tool in several professional writing seminars. More
                    specifically, the author discusses a key moment in the semester where students
                    needed to move between university and non-university technology infrastructures
                    in order to create multiplayer gamespaces that were accessible to their peers.
                    In narrating this experience, the author will demonstrate how a discourse of
                        âaccessâ can be used to examine the oft-invisible
                    policies, procedures, and restrictions that shape the way we compose, circulate
                    and make visible digitally-native work. Furthermore, the author will discuss how
                    a critical emphasis on âaccessâ can help teachers and
                    students better mediate the relationship between internal or university-supplied
                    technological infrastructures and external platforms when creating interactive
                    digital projects.
                The underlying motivation of this essay is not to lambaste universities for lack
                    of institutional support nor is it to champion commercial organizations as
                    saviors for helping teachers successfully use digital platforms in the
                    classroom. Instead, the goal of this brief essay is to spur discussions
                    surrounding the following questions: how might we use issues regarding access to
                    better examine and navigate the hard-to-define boundaries that separate
                    university-sanction technology use from non-university sanctioned technology
                    use? How might calling students' attention to access refine the larger learning

                In this article I call for more recognition of and scholarly engagement with
                    public, volunteer digital humanities projects, using the example of LibriVox.org
                    to consider what public, sustainable, digital humanities work can look like
                    beyond the contexts of institutional sponsorship. Thousands of volunteers are
                    using LibriVox to collaboratively produce free audiobook versions of texts in
                    the US public domain. The work of finding, selecting, and preparing texts to be
                    digitized and published in audio form is complex and slow, and not all of this
                    labor is ultimately visible, valued, or rewarded. Drawing on an ethnographic
                    study of 12 years of archived discourse and documentation, I interrogate digital
                    traces of the processes by which several LibriVox versions of Anne of Green Gables have come into being, watching
                    for ways in which policies and infrastructure have been influenced by variously
                    visible and invisible forms of work. Making visible the intricate, unique,

                FemTechNet is a relatively small and loosely affiliated feminist, anti-racist
                    collective which focuses on overlaps between and implications of feminism and

                    traditional hierarchies through distributed power and collective creation. In an
                    examination of hidden labor and archival silences, this research addresses how
                    ideological underpinnings shaped the process of envisioning an institutional
                    archive of FemTechNet records, how principles held by FemTechNet reverberated
                    through the archival process, and how FemTechNet members conceptualized the
                    imagined institutionally-held archive. The research reveals that the collective
                    navigated institutional requirements and resources, the risks inherent in the

                Over the past few decades, the ever-expanding media of the digital world,
                    including digital humanities endeavors, have become more reliant on the results
                    of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) software. Yet, unfortunately,
                    medievalists have not had as much success with using OCR software on handwritten
                    manuscripts as scholars using printed books as their sources. While some
                    projects to ameliorate this situation have emerged in recent years, using
                    software to create machine-readable results from medieval manuscripts is still
                    in its infancy. This article presents the results of a series of successful
                    experiments with open-source neural network OCR software on medieval
                    manuscripts. Results over the course of these experiments yielded character and
                    word accuracy rates over 90%, reaching 94% and 97% accuracy in some instances.
                    Such results are not only viable for creating machine-readable texts but also
                    pose new avenues for bringing together manuscript studies and digital humanities
                    in ways previously unrealized. A closer examination of the experiments indicates
                    regular patterns among the OCR results that could potentially allow for use
                    cases beyond pure text recognition, such as for paleographic classifications of
                    script types.

                This paper explores different ways of modelling and simulating complex spatial
                    and temporal events, such as battles, for which it has been practically
                    impossible to (re)construct the thousands if not hundreds of thousands of
                    variables of which they are comprised. This research utilises as a case study
                    the Battle of Mount Street Bridge of the Irish Easter 1916 Rising, in which the
                    number of British casualties has been fiercely debated. The research is framed
                    within the theory and practice of digital scholarly editions, which provides a
                    new paradigm for approaching virtual worlds in a contextualized and annotated
                    environment. This paper also discusses the challenges of creating virtual worlds
                    for online environments in which there is rapid obsolescence of software and

                    inscribes itself within the federated model of the Advanced Research Consortium
                    (ARC). With the project now in its third year, MuSO has reached an inflection
                    point where it has developed a music-centered RDF schema and demonstrated the
                    potential for federated searching across ARC nodes by crosswalking
                    eighteenth-century music content from Europeana into ARC. The case study
                    presented here outlines the dissemination role that MuSO proposes to play within
                    the music research community, the history of MuSO in relation to ARC, the
                    Europeana test case, and future steps for the continued development of MuSO. By
                    facilitating the discovery of digital music content, and providing a virtual
                    environment for music researchers, MuSO will promote data reuse, strengthen
                    community standards in music representation, and create possibilities for
                    cross-disciplinary exchange. We propose that by leveraging the connections
                    between digital music resources and digital humanities research technologies,
                    MuSO will facilitate new research that expands the musicological discipline.

                Data visualization has rapidly become a standard approach to interrogating and
                    understanding the world around us in domains that extend beyond the technical
                    and scientific to arts, communications and services. In business settings the
                    Data Scientist has become a recognized and valued role . Journalism has re-oriented itself around
                    data-driven storytelling as a potential saviour for an industry in peril . Governments are moving to more data-driven decision
                    making, publishing open data portals and pondering visualization as an
                    opportunity for citizen participation . This
                    journal itself has numerous examples that use visualization tools and techniques
                    within the digital humanities as a tool for exploration 
                    
                    .
                This boom in attention has led large new populations of learners into the field.
                    Formal educational settings have rushed to create new approaches and
                    introductions to this content, but often they fall back on traditional
                    approaches to things such as scientific charting and graphing 
                    . Many view data visualization as a new technology,
                    which runs the risks of replicating old approaches without acknowledging the
                    unique affordances and domains that data visualization relies upon. Data
                    visualization is not simply another technology to integrate into education. It
                    is visual argument and persuasion, far more closely associated with rhetoric and
                    writing than spreadsheets .
                In this paper we present novel approaches to learning technologies and
                    activities, focused on novice learners entering the field of data driven
                    storytelling. We begin with a deeper dive into the problems we see with
                    introducing new learners into a field characterized by inequality, continue with
                    a discussion of approaches for introducing technologies to education, and
                    summarize the inspirational pedagogies we build on. We then offer some design
                    principles and three activities as examples of the concept of creative data
                    literacy. We assert that creative approaches grounded in constructionist
                    educational theories are necessary to empower non-technical learners to be able
                    to tell stories and argue for change with data.

                The proliferation of tools that enable anyone to create visualizations of their
                    data, even with limited experience or skills, has made data visualization more
                    accessible than ever before. This is true in its use in both teaching and
                    learning, as data visualization has increasingly taken on an important
                    pedagogical role in the classroom and in scholarly research. However, with this
                    proliferation of tools there has been a concomitant awareness that visualization
                    needs to be employed through a critical lens that acknowledges its
                    constructedness as explanatory medium and as a product of situated knowledges.
                    Here, I describe one approach to teaching this notion of constructedness via a
                    framework oriented around information literacy, which encourages critical
                    engagement with data, the tools we use to interrogate them, and the
                    visualizations we design to represent them. I describe this approach through a
                    collection of âcritical dichotomiesâ used to evaluate the
                    authority and value of visualizations, which are mapped to a subset of the core
                    information literacy competencies defined in the ACRL
                        Framework for Information Literacy in Higher Education. To put these
                    dichotomies into practice, I further describe an interactive activity called
                        âChoose Your Own Adventure, with Data
                        Visualization,â in which participants are given paper and markers to
                    create booklets in the style of Choose Your Own
                        Adventure books and asked to consider the relationship between
                    active choices in the design process of a visualization and how a given
                    visualization is interpreted. In the process, I explore how this framework can
                    encourage us all, as critical practitioners of visualization, to think about the
                    practical relationship between data visualization and information literacy more
                    generally.

                For many years, digital humanists have responded to Alan Liuâs call for critical
                    digital humanities. Projects such as #TornApart/Seperados and
                    #PuertoRicoMapathon and pieces like âWhere is Cultural
                        Criticism in the Digital Humanities?â
                    , âAll the Digital Humanists Are
                        White, All the Nerds Are Men, but Some of Us Are Braveâ
                    , and âBeyond the Margins:
                        Intersectionality and the Digital Humanitiesâ
                     have paved the way for socially conscious
                    developments in the field. At the same time, pressures from administrators,
                    institutions, and funding agencies often discourage critical engagement in favor
                    of tool development and/or âhigh techâ projects . As such, we often attempt to adapt highly rewarded
                    tech skills, like text, sentiment, and big data analyses, for use in social
                    justice projects. While it is possible for these two aims to be compatible, we
                    do ourselves a disservice when we try to force them together. So, how should
                    teacher-scholars implement an intersectional digital humanities framework in the
                    classroom? Using my own classroom as a case study, I assert that one effective
                    strategy is through curation, which helps students investigate topics such as
                    race, gender, sexuality, disability, and socioeconomic status through the
                    careful selection, arrangement, and presentation of materials. Doing so teaches
                    students to think more critically about the act of curation, by encouraging them
                    to participate in knowledge construction as well as the dismantling of harmful
                    narratives and power structures. While this approach differs from the tool-based
                    pedagogy often utilized in the field, its emphasis on knowledge production,
                    critical thinking, digital literacy, and social justice gives students
                    proficiency in socially conscious methodologies that can be applied to any
                    project. Linking curation to making and breaking, two digital humanities
                    approaches to meaning-making, provides a method for interrogating âarchives of humanityâ and
                    developing a pedagogy grounded in cultural critique and social justice .

                The popularity of information visualization in academia and practice brings a
                    renewed emphasis on aesthetic values and visual applications to ensure its
                    appeal to a wider audience. This paper focuses on visualization aesthetics and
                    perception by making the case for using graphic design techniques and design
                    languages to understand and create more aesthetically pleasant and functionally
                    effective information design and visualization. It uses cross-disciplinary
                    reviews of background research to demonstrate the value of graphic design
                    principles and methods in the realm of visualization education. A user-centered
                    design framework and student projects are discussed by adapting graphic design
                    elements into the visualization process. It shows that the practice of
                    developing a visualization should be executed with an understanding of graphic
                    design basics in mind, and with a balanced consideration of tangible and
                    conditional design elements, as well as how these design elements fulfill the

                The use of new technologies, media and computational methods in Humanities may
                    evolve and indeed it is already changing the âcontentsâ and
                        âformsâ of contemporary education, opening new scenarios
                    previously unimaginable. Nowadays Visual Mobile Devices, smartphones, tablets,
                    etc, contribute to a range of computer-mediated activities, which are related to
                    specific locations and times. But for such critical reflection, we need a closer
                    look to deeper layers of our culture to unveil the characteristics of new
                    technologies and devices. This paper describes some emerging aspects of the
                    teaching use of visual communication techniques in primary and secondary
                    schooling. In particular it reviews the evidence of the efficiency of visual
                    communication for learning both in varied curriculum disciplines and of
                    transversal socio-ethical affective skills necessary for the promotion of health
                    and the construction of a planetary citizenship. The paper illuminates the
                    didactic applicability and unique potential of images for the epistemological
                    peculiarities of different disciplines, highlighting how educational use of
                    images in creative pedagogy can be more focused given the function they perform
                    in the more general cognitive process of individuals. The theoretical analysis
                    of the teaching validity of the use of visual communication, as reported in the
                    international literature, seems to receive confirmation from a case study, which
                    provides detailed analyses of how this technique can enhance specific projects
                    and demonstrates its significance for wider practitioners.

                Among the most elaborate and coherent instances of Renaissance self-fashioning
                    and female self-determination through culture was a suite of rooms designed by
                    Isabella dâEste in what is now the Ducal Palace museum of Mantua, Italy: a
                    full-blown personal studiolo (study) and an
                    adjoining smaller chamber she called the grotta
                    (grotto). Isabellaâs studiolo is a regular point of reference in the study of
                    Renaissance history and art, yet for centuries it has been accessible only in
                    dispersed pieces and in spaces depopulated of major works and artefacts. Digital
                    technology offers the possibility of creating a âremasteredâ
                    studiolo, a virtual space in which both visual and acoustic elements may be
                    enhanced with respect to previous attempts at its representation. At the same
                    time, historical uncertainty about numerous details in the arrangement of the
                    objects in this collection requires a high level of flexibility in the digital
                    remix, allowing for the programming of a customisable virtual environment. In
                    anticipation of the projectâs full construction and in order to facilitate
                    discussion with potential users about the Virtual Studioloâs backward design,
                    the authors have developed a concept-demonstration video within the open-source
                    Blender environment (www.blender.org). Among the concerns we aim to address in this phase
                    of the project is how to combine historical accuracy, emotional power, and
                    creative possibilities for users. This case study presents some of the
                    opportunities, constraints and challenges we confronted during the production of
                    our video as we strove within the Blender open environment for a result that
                    will be historically accurate, emotionally compelling, and creatively flexible.

                Data visualizations are inherently rhetorical, and therefore bias-laden visual
                    artifacts that contain both explicit and implicit arguments. The implicit
                    arguments depicted in data visualizations are the net result of many seemingly
                    minor decisions about data and design from inception of a research project
                    through to final publication of the visualization. Data workflow, selected
                    visualization formats, and individual design decisions made within those formats
                    all frame and direct the possible range of interpretation, and the potential for
                    harm of any data visualization. Considering this, it is imperative that we take
                    an ethical approach to the creation and use of data visualizations. Therefore,
                    we have suggested an ethical data visualization workflow with the dual aim of
                    minimizing harm to the subjects of our study and the audiences viewing our
                    visualization, while also maximizing the explanatory capacity and effectiveness
                    of the visualization itself. To explain this ethical data visualization
                    workflow, we examine two recent digital mapping projects, Racial Terror
                    Lynchings and Map of White Supremacy Mob Violence.

                Technologies used to study and represent the past are not hermeneutically
                    neutral. Since technologies have illocutionary force, we should ask of any
                    representation of history, In what ways are the associated
                        technologies conveying meaning? In this article, the question will be
                    asked of a particular kind of history, textual history, taking biblical texts as
                    an illustrative example. The goal is to better understand how textual
                    technologies of yesterday, today, or tomorrow capture or obscure the material
                    history of their texts. The article proceeds in two main parts. First, two kinds
                    of technologies commonly used are examined and compared: the non-digital book
                    and its familiar digital counterparts. Second, we will consider ways in which
                    augmented reality and virtual reality have been used and might be used to
                    represent texts. It will be suggested that these new technologies may overcome
                    some of the limitation of previous book technologies in capturing a textâs
                    history. In conclusion, practical suggestions will be made for those who read,
                    study, or produce digital textual objects.

                    appealing only to the sense of vision. We propose that new technologies may be

                    created performance pieces in a genre of Graeco-Roman dance for use in a
                    motion-capture system. It was necessary for the performers to develop a range of
                    translational strategies in order to communicate their movement to the system,

                 Over the past decades the advancement of technology and its subsequent
                    introduction to the humanities has led to the development of several
                    applications that enhance study and research in areas such as Classics,
                    archaeology, epigraphy, and linguistics. The focus of digital humanists and
                    other humanities scholars has turned to the efficient storage of information
                    that facilitates search, comparative studies, accessibility, and consequently
                    research. The common point of reference for the aforementioned applications is
                    that they do not involve the need for the scholar to
                        âphysicallyâ be in a virtual space. In areas, such as
                    archaeology and epigraphy, the creation of projects that provide access to 3D
                    models of the artifacts as well as to virtual replications of ancient sites has
                    resulted in the opening of new areas of research and reconsideration of
                    traditional research issues. Also,  argue that digital
                    visualizations may make the ancient world more accessible to a larger audience.
                    One may comprehend the structure of a vase and analyze its artistic patterns by
                    zooming and relighting it. A problem that is yet to be considered, though, is
                    how a scholar and a student are to perceive Classical drama, the theatrical
                    space, the distances between the actors, the chorus, and the audience, the
                    logistics of the performance, and the cultural aspects at play. This paper
                    discusses the importance of experiential learning and the use of virtual reality
                    as a means of promoting traditional edification methods, virtually recreating
                    the actuality of the stage, and presents the Magic Mirror Theater, a web
                    application designed to facilitate the study of Classical drama.

                The history of human-environment interaction is embedded in stone. Stones are
                    essential components of daily life and their various usage characterize certain
                    areas or chronological periods. The form of a stone object is the result of a
                    long chain of interactions with distinct bodies but the intangible life story of
                    any artefact is partially registered in its original material properties and
                    gradual physical alteration. Digital systems can be adopted for collecting these
                    invisible records and tracing a stoneâs history. Chemical imaging and portable
                    spectroscopy are quick and non-destructive remote sensing techniques that can be
                    used to gather empirical data and track production and use of stone artefacts
                    over time. This article reviews the application of Near Infrared Spectroscopy as
                    a method for geochemical characterization of objects and as a tool for
                    provenance studies within the Mobima project, carried out by an
                    interdisciplinary team of archaeologists and chemists at University of UmeÃ¥,
                    Sweden.
                Near Infrared Spectroscopy can be used for acquiring and processing spectral
                    information directly in the field, modelling datasets of big assemblages and
                    classifying objects.
                Making stonesâ biographies visible will help understanding the entanglement of
                    past societies and their geological landscapes.

                    adoption of digital tools transforms the established methods of managing primary
                    and secondary sources, bringing hastier digital workflows to traditionally more
                    methodical work. Finally, we show that efficiency cannot be qualified as a
                    neutral or inherent characteristic of digital tools, independent of scholarsâ
                    practices, since scholarsâ interaction with digital artifacts determines what
                    constitutes efficiency of a tool in the context of a scholarâs workflow. We
                    conclude that in humanistsâ workflows digital and analog tools and resources do
                    not necessarily replace one another or vie for the dominant position. They
                    rather supplement each other in an interconnected, hybrid workflow that comes to
                    our respondents as an organic manifestation of their work, and as an
                    illustration of the bricolage character of humanistsâ digital workflows.

                    between Charles Bernsteinâs close listening and Tanya Clementâs distant
                    listening. While itâs tempting to think of these approaches as presenting an
                    integral of scope, Bernsteinâs work proposes the use and tuning of the human ear
                    for understanding the sonic materiality of the phonotext, while Clementâs work,
                    following its namesake of Morettiâs distant reading, calls for a form of
                    surrogate listening âÂ using the machine in place of the ear. Building on
                    Bernsteinâs work and toward Clementâs, I suggest MachineâAided Close Listening
                    as a methodology that uses data visualization as a prosthetic extension of the
                    ear. This is to say that by considering three dimensions of the phonotext â 1)
                    the textual manifestation of the poem, 2) the audio of the poet performing it,
                    and 3) a visualization of that audio â the readerâlistener can empirically
                    confirm the earâs impressions and expose new facets of the sonic materiality of
                    the performed poem. In support of this methodology, I will demonstrate a new
                    digital tool for aligning these three facets of the phonotext.

                 Distraction is not a problem for scholarly reading in the humanities: it is, in
                    fact, intrinsic to how we work. An openness to distraction facilitates knowledge
                    creation in conversation with and between sources, bringing together disparate
                    times and places, authors and forms of source material, frames of reference and
                    layers of insight, harnessing peripheral vision as much as central focus to
                    create the conditions for serendipitous discovery. This âloose
                        holdâ on focus results in a knowledgescape with a substantial
                    tacit dimension, with the result that humanists most certainly know more than we
                    can tell. This is not to say that the epistemic process of the humanist is all
                    encompassing, however: administrative work, for example, is viewed as a
                        âtrueâ distraction, and managed accordingly. 
                In spite of the wide availability of digital tools to consolidate and organise
                    the process of extracting information from the reading of sources (be they text,
                    image, landscape or indeed even the self), the notetaking process of the
                    humanist remains stubbornly multimodal, harnessing embodied, material, and
                    spatial dimensions of knowledge. The resulting knowledge environments humanists
                    create around themselves resemble life-sized realisations in mixed media of a
                    Prezi stack, a physical manifestation of the fragmented, capricious, haphazard
                    stream of influences jostling for scholarly attention, and the scholarâs
                    understanding that their system inter-relationships are complex, sometimes
                    tenuous, and largely undiscovered.
                This article will lay out the evidence for and implications of this understanding
                    of humanistic reading, and then explore possible future paths for using
                    technology to explore and indeed celebrate distraction, including: Technology as
                    blurring the line between the personal and the professional, not so much as a
                    labour practice, but as an epistemic one opening the way to the validation of
                        âepistemic emotionsâ as a valid research input, but also
                    to the more effective convergence of humanities research with other inputs to
                    the identity formation process of seemingly distracted undergraduates; and
                    research infrastructural implications for libraries (where remote storage and
                    electronic catalogues diminish the likelihood for serendipity, essentially by
                    reducing distraction) but also for vitual research environments founded upon a

            Reading has always been a contentious and political practice, but this is heightened
               in the contemporary moment both because of the way the environments in which we read
               are changing so radically. For Katherine Hayles reading is 
                  âa powerful technology for reconfiguring
                     activity patterns in the brainâ
                  
               , a view representative of attempts to connect the new neuroscience of reading
               with age old practices of literary endeavour. For Sven Birkerts, however, 
                  âthe Internet and the novel are
                     oppositesâ
                  
               , a view that suggests that a hierarchy of reading that locks digital readers
               out of higher order thinking and literary experience. Meanwhile, Anne Mangen finds
               that electronic reading environments 
                  ânegatively aï¬ect emotional aspects of
                     readingâ
                  
               . But these approaches tend to understand reading as something static that
               occurs in one space or another. However, in practice our reading is increasingly
               distributed. Reading can occur in multiple formats, across multiple platforms for the
               one text or reading experience. A novel begun in print can be read online in a
               born-digital format and concluded in a scanned digital format, for example. These
               journeys across platform require deeper investigation.
            If we think of the printed book as an interface between two orders of thinking, we
               need to consider how the experience of reading a digitized version of a formerly
               printed and bound book alters literary reception and student experience. How does the
               experience of reading across different technological platforms change the readerâs
               relationship to the content? As more and more electronic reading platforms take on
               the physical attributes of material reading experiences either by retaining material
               traces or by emulating them, we might question what experience How do the material
               traces left on digitised works impact the reading process for reading in literary
               studies? The lively discourse surrounding Google Books and the human breaches of the
               material into the immaterial, as the work crosses the borders of formats and
               interfaces, raises valuable questions about the future of the book, reading in the
               twenty-first century, and the long and formidable shadow that centuries of material
               text production casts over Google Booksâ electronic utopia. This paper uses both book
               history and new media interface theory to consider the multitude of diverse
               experiences that is literary reading across different platforms in and out of the
               classroom and to consider whether distracted reading can be better understood as
               distributed reading. It considers critical infrastructure studies as a useful
               framework through which to think about reading in the digital age.

            The advent of handheld digital devices has proved to be revolutionary for the
               teaching of art history. They make it possible to supplement, even replace, the
               traditional format of lecturing and communal viewing of a single screen. On their
               personal screens, students can enter a searchable world of thousands of virtual
               images: what the radical art theorist and novelist AndrÃ© Malraux, more than half a
               century ago, called âthe imaginary museum.â For several years, I
               have been experimenting with my art history classes, showing my students how to use
               their laptops, tablets and phones to become active viewers and collaborators.
            Multiple virtual images transform the content, as well as the environment, of
               learning art history. Rather than being restricted to the illustrations in a
               textbook, students can use their devices to engage with online image sources such as
               museum websites, image databanks, and auction houses. Portable digital technology can
               turn the art history classroom into a collaborative and dynamic experience
               inconceivable a short time ago. Malraux himself, who believed in the power of art to
               transcend time and space, might be amazed at what is now not only possible, but
               commonplace.

                With the increasing proliferation of digital technologies into our daily
                    routines, long-standing debates have resurfaced on the potential of prosthetic
                    devices to extend our cognitive capacities and distribute intelligence across
                    human and non-human agents. This article will propose ways in which we, as
                    educators, can harness the distractions that new technologies can pose to
                    teaching and research towards productive models of distributed attention and
                    collective intelligence.
                By reflecting on the relationship between play and pedagogy through critical
                    theory, as well as on the benefits of hyper-connected and collaborative
                    learning, this article hopes to expand the branch of Digital Humanities that
                    Holly Willis terms as the âcinematic
                        humanities.â Remixing, recontextualization, and the
                    non-linear/non-sequential reconfiguration of information can provide us with new
                    modes of distributed attention and critical making in the digital age.
                This article focuses on low and no-budget process-oriented collaborative projects
                    for Cinema, Media Studies, and Digital Humanities courses (adjustable to other
                    subject matters) that incorporate remixing, social and locative media, and
                    augmented reality into experimental modes of connected and collaborative
                    learning. The first assignment is a live film scoring remix, where students
                    collectively brainstormed on picking sound clips/samples to add new soundtracks
                    to early silent films. Remixing practices can offer new insights into cinema's
                    legacy and challenge ocularcentric notions of film spectatorship by, in this
                    case, reversing the conventional hierarchy of image-sound into sound-image and
                    reflecting on how our minds attempt to process the impulse of sensory
                    synchronization in cinema. The second sample assignment proposes new ways of
                    using easy-to-learn and accessible GIS (Geographic Information System) and AR
                    (Augmented Reality) tools to create projects related to civic engagement and
                    local/online activism.
                The drifts from pre-determined learning outcomes are meant to be active
                    disruptions to any prescribed limitations that delimit what digital humanities
                    should or should not be, and other issues that often undermine the potential
                    contributions to digital humanities that derive from the intellectual and
                    material labor that happens in the networked, expanded and distributed
                    classroom. The remix aesthetic, the âunfinishedâ and
                    makeshift nature of these projects is something that I find adds value to this
                    kind of process-oriented pedagogy because it remains in touch with the
                    pre-institutionalized experimental ethos that prompted the formation of the
                    digital humanities and other disciplinary cross-pollinations.

                Rather than seeing hypertext as offering only distracted reading, this paper
                    argues that annotation software provides students with the opportunity to
                    perform recursive reading: a process that facilitates knowledge transfer and
                    encourages intersectional critical approaches to texts. As hypertext editions
                    and online reading communities have proliferated, scholars have theorized that
                    these layered, interactive modes of reading produce distracted readings of
                    texts, especially in pedagogical contexts. With annotation software, however,
                    researchers and students have the opportunity not just to consume these
                    distracted readings, but to produce them. Within the classroom, annotation
                    software assignments require a deeper psychological investment from students
                    than simply consuming a hypertext edition. By choosing how and where to annotate
                    a particular text, studentsâ distributed modes of attention are re-focused on
                    the text itself, pulling disparate threads of thought together.

                    little computer in our pockets or bring a lightweight laptop to class, boredom
                    is a feeling that we almost never have to face anymore. We instantly alleviate
                    the slightest hint of impatience or aimlessness with a single glance at our
                    screens. But what introspective capacities do we neglect when we reflexively
                    give ourselves over to the distractions of the outside world? What might
                    dwelling within our boredom open up to students? Using my undergraduate

                    approach to digital media provides STEM students in particular with a means of
                    contextualizing technical detail within larger sociopolitical systems, and that
                    a focus on individual habits of attention can provide an important hinge between
                    the granular and the global. Next, I reflect on the pressures produced by the
                    very devices we studied on the classroom environment, and frame our experiences
                    within some of the most influential writings on boredom as a historically and
                    technologically conditioned mood. I then conclude with some speculations on
                    planning for boredom within a laptop policy that is capable of accounting for a
                    range of learning styles.

            This paper examines the potentialities of networked browsing, a form of
               faceted searching that visualizes digital archives in the form of a force-directed
               network graph. Using BigDIVA.org as an example of networked browsing, this paper
               presents the results of a small usability study that compared how participants (N = 8) engaged with BigDIVAâs networked browsing in comparison
               to use of a search engine such as Google. In doing so, we situate our study within
               performative conceptualizations of human-computer interfaces  in order to explore the potential becomings when human and
               nonhuman machinic component are entangled together. Based on the observations from
               our usability study, we argue that networked browsing is suggestive of Whitelawâs
               (2015) âgenerous interfacingâ that emphasizes browsing as
               a tool for exploring relationships between nodes in archives, as well as

                 Digital humanities have a long tradition of using advanced computational
                    techniques and machine learning to aid humanistic enquiry. In this paper, we
                    concentrate on a specific subfield of machine learning called predictive
                    analytics and its use in digital humanities. Predictive analytics has evolved
                    from descriptive analytics, which creates summaries of data, while predictive
                    analytics predicts relationships within the data that also help to explain new
                    data. Predictive analytics uses machine learning techniques but also traditional
                    statistical methods. It uses properties (or features) of the data to predict
                    another target feature in the data. Machine learning is used by predictive
                    analytics to establish the rules that given a certain combination of features
                    make the target more or less likely. Predictive analytics can thus be considered
                    to be a technique to machine-read data. The paper discusses the background of
                    predictive analytics, its use for predicting the past and finally presents a
                    case study in predicting past gender relations in a historical dataset.
                    Predicting the past is introduced as a method to explore relationships in past
                    data.

                The Jesuit scholar, Roberto Busa, is often called the founder of humanities
                    computing. In fact, starting as early as 1949, he collaborated with IBM to
                    perform experiments using suites of punched-card machines. These punched-card
                    data systems â with their plug-board setups, clacking machinery, and flurries of
                    perforated rectangular cards â were developed for business accounting and
                    tabulating, and adapted for government censuses, defense calculations, archival
                    management, and information processing of all kinds. The first decade of

            The fate of the medieval Aesop during the early age of print reveals the tensions
               that arise between corporeal and proprietary understandings
               of artistic production. Building upon the highly accumulative, various, and
               expandable Aesopic tradition that thrived in the Middle Ages within scholastic
               manuscripts, the fifteenth-century fables of Robert Henryson and William Caxton
               confront movements to consolidate and transform Aesopâs sprawling literary corpus
               into a singular printable property. At the same time that a single series of Aesopâs
               fables, now known as the elegiac Romulus, became
               increasingly standardized within printed books, woodcut illustrations and textual
               descriptions increasingly beautified Aesopâs body, transforming him from an
               inarticulate slave to an eloquent aristocrat. The simultaneous metamorphosis of
               Aesopâs poetic and visual corpus reveals the premodern underpinnings for current
               efforts by publishing industries to immunize digital work from rogue acts of
               appropriation, mashup, and remix, practices which had previously defined Aesopic
               textuality. As a response to this textual vulnerability, the collapse of Aesopic work
               into a singular entity reimagines the allegorical relationship between the author or
               publisher and the work as proprietary, not corporeal. Rather than an extension of a
               generative, deeply somatic, and grotesque process of multiple fabular authors and
               commentators, the modernized Aesop obtains value as a âproperty,â
               paving the way for the notion that creative corpuses can be
                  âowned,â effectively stealing away corporeal features from
               intellectual production.

                The rise of the use of computational methods in both the study and production of
                    literature poses questions about how to best read works of electronic literature
                    which engage a wider sphere of human context beyond the literary text itself.
                    Taking a cue from modes of âdistant readingâ that have taken
                    advantage of computational methods in order to pursue empirical and
                    sociologically-influenced readings of traditional textual corpora, the liminal
                    case of âambient literatureâ is examined. As a form of
                    electronic literature developed out of the field of ubiquitous computing,
                    ambient literature presents a literature which is intimately connected to the
                    situation of the reader, offering a text whose meaning is both variable and
                    specific to the conditions of its engagement. Having confronted analogous issues
                    in other domains, traditions of research in human-computer interaction offer
                    methodological insight into how such works might be read. Developing an account
                    of how literary texts may be read from a distance through user studies, an
                    ethnomethodological analysis of the experience of these hybrid works of
                    electronic literature is advanced. By drawing connections between literary
                    studies and human-computer interaction, new methods which focus on the analysis
                    of the experience of multiple readers as they encounter works of electronic
                    literature establish opportunities for future research into the contextual,
                    embodied, and computational nature of literature today.

                        The question about cyberspace has generally been polarized around the
                            concepts real / virtual and natural / artificial. The notion of space
                            stands out among the empirical categories that have been handled such as
                            real and natural. The spread of Internet has perpetuated this
                            controversy. Thus, it is possible to distinguish a new opposition: on
                            one hand, cyberspace understood as a deterritorialized, democratic and
                            meaningless non-place; on the other hand, as a place subject to
                            territorializing and identity movements that would come to put new
                            borders, including the âdigital divideâ, due to the
                            dominance of globalization in the context of the network society. In
                            this regard, thanks to the speed and possibility of almost universal
                            interconnection, the dominant flows âmodelâ the space
                            through the inclusion and exclusion of those nodes, more or less
                            valuable for their interests. This paper will focus on analyzing the
                            (cyber)space, and therefore it will criticize the dialectical
                            simplifying the dialectics center and periphery or territorialization
                            and deterritorialization.

                        Ante la creciente popularidad de los laboratorios como espacios de
                            innovaciÃ³n, presentamos un marco de referencia sobre los fundamentos que

                            Ã¡mbito acadÃ©mico, en particular al campo de las humanidades digitales.
                            Partimos de la hipÃ³tesis de que las humanidades digitales en
                            IberoamÃ©rica pueden recuperar algunas de las aportaciones de los
                            laboratorios ciudadanos para expandir sus alcances a travÃ©s de la
                            incorporaciÃ³n de nuevos actores y metodologÃ­as; establecer una posiciÃ³n

                            circulaciÃ³n y consumo del conocimiento. Por ello, este texto tiene como
                            propÃ³sito caracterizar la cultura del laboratorio y analizar las
                            posibilidades de su apropiaciÃ³n para promover procesos de producciÃ³n de

                        Given the growing popularity of laboratories as spaces for innovation, we
                            present a framework of reference on the fundamentals that characterize
                            them and explore their possibilities of incorporation into the academy,
                            particularly in the field of digital humanities. We start from the
                            hypothesis that the digital humanities in Spanish-speaking Latin America
                            can recover some of the contributions of citizen laboratories to expand
                            their reach through the incorporation of new actors and methodologies;
                            establish a critical position against the dominant systems of knowledge
                            production in the humanities on our current geopolitical scenarios; and
                            design, make visible and recognize models and alternative loci of
                            production, circulation and consumption of knowledge. Therefore, this
                            article aims to characterize the culture of the laboratory and analyze
                            the possibilities of its appropriation to promote processes of
                            production of open knowledge in university environments, and in
                            particular in the field of Ibero-American digital humanities.

                        En este artÃ­culo, estudio la colecciÃ³n de blogs literarios en espaÃ±ol que
                            comprende Elboomeran(g), un gigantesco blog literario de mÃ¡s de diez
                            aÃ±os y veinte blogueros. Utilizando tanto la lectura distante como la
                            cercana, afirmo que el contenido de los blogs revela dos componentes
                            importantes de la estÃ©tica transnacional: en primer lugar, a nivel de la
                            poÃ©tica, al igual que en el mundo analÃ³gico, seguimos observando
                            tendencias textuales que se alejan de los temas y espacios asociados con
                            la experiencia nacional, y el mismo reblandecimiento de las fronteras
                            nacionales que se evidencia en la escritura latinoamericana
                            contemporÃ¡nea. En segundo lugar, el terreno en lÃ­nea nos obliga a
                            cuestionar la relaciÃ³n entre el espacio y la pertenencia nacional,
                            porque sirve como Ã¡mbito para la actividad lectora posnacional sobre la
                            base de territorios de la lengua. Ambos aspectos son centrales para
                            profundizar el estudio de la escritura digital y el modo en que esta
                            opera en el marco mÃ¡s amplio de las tendencias hacia el
                            transnacionalismo. En el presente trabajo, considero en quÃ© medida
                            podemos incluir los espacios virtuales entre las variantes del
                            extranacionalismo, dado que a nivel nacional se los sigue discutiendo.
                        
                    
                        In this article, I study the collection of literary blogs in Spanish that
                            composes Elboomeran(g), a vast literary blog of more than ten years and
                            twenty bloggers. Employing both distant and close readings, I argue that
                            the content of the blogs reveals two important components of
                            transnational aesthetics: first, at the level of poetics, we continue to
                            observe textual tendencies that move away from the themes and spaces
                            associated with national experience, and the same softening of national
                            borders that is evident in contemporary Latin American writing. Second,
                            the online terrain forces us to question the relationship between space
                            and national belonging because it serves as an arena for post-national
                            reader engagement based on language territories. Both aspects are
                            central to furthering scholarship on digital writing and the way it
                            operates within the broader framework of trans-nationalism. In the
                            present work, I consider to what extent we can include virtual spaces as
                            a variants of extra-nationalism, given that they continue to be
                            contested on a national level.

                        The online project http://historyofaboriginalsydney.edu.au, now based at the
                            University of Western Sydney, takes the educational and digital
                            initiatives of today in a new direction. Dividing the city of Sydney
                            into six geographic regions, we created a site based on the history of
                            the Aborigines of Sydney since the invasion by the English colonisers.
                            The site incorporates new forms of tagging, time line and digital mapping
                            to present multiple pathways of information in textual, video and
                            photographic form. After seven years of investigation, we can offer our
                            website balanced between unearthing lost knowledge and discovering new
                            sources of information. We have incorporated all these into the site
                            while exploring the potential for digital mapping and animation for
                            purposes both of education and research. After carefully consulting
                            professional Aboriginal educational groups, we believe that we have
                            created a digital Indigenous history of Sydney, while at the same time
                            returning to the Aborigines the history of which they have been deprived
                            for so long.This article is based on our previous papers in

                  The digitization of texts is omnipresent in the digital humanities. It seems to

                     paper to digital text. But it does more than that. Digitization also affects
                     the text as a semiotic object. The multiple operations of this technology
                     implement interpretative decisions that are not without their effects on the
                     semiotic text; that is to say, the text that offers itself for reading and
                     analysis. In this sense, the digitization of texts is not neutral. It is an
                     important moment of material hermeneutics.

                  In the last decades, â distant reading â became one of the most promising
                     methodologies in the domain of computer-assisted literary analysis. This paper
                     looks at an alternative path for gathering new insights about the literary
                     texts, that of the â shared reading â, or â crowd reading â,
                     consisting in multiple readings of the same text, performed by various readers
                     and analysed so as to uncover new theoretical insights about the literary
                     phenomenon, based on the observation of similarities and divergences amongst
                     readers in text interpretation and text understanding. More precisely, this
                     paper presents an experience of crowd reading applied to the modeling of
                     literary characters, in view of a semi-automated analysis of these literary
                     objects.

                  Understanding the evolution of a forest territory requires taking both time and

                     personnage de Sganarelle, qui apparaÃ®t dans plusieurs piÃ¨ces de MoliÃ¨re, en
                     vers et en prose, et qui reprÃ©sente souvent le Â«Â bourgeois de
                        ParisÂ Â», dont les valeurs vont Ã  lâencontre de celles que
                     partagent les mondains. Lâanalyse des rÃ©sultats est menÃ©e du point de vue de ce
                     que D. Biber et S. Conrad appellent la register perspective, afin

                     Sganarelle en fonction de la situation de communication dans laquelle sâinscrit
                     leur discours. Les rÃ©sultats montrent les diffÃ©rentes faÃ§ons dont MoliÃ¨re
                     exploite le personnage Ã  mesure que sâaffirme le nouveau comique quâil met en
                     Åuvre, un comique fondÃ© sur le jeu avec les valeurs de la sociÃ©tÃ© mondaine.
                  
               
                  Quantitative studies in the syntax of MoliÃ¨re are not very frequent. The
                     present paper proposes a syntactic analysis of MoliÃ¨reâs characters that relies
                     on the extraction of part of speech sequences and their filtering using
                     correspondence analysis. In particular, the methodology is applied to the study
                     of the evolution of the character of Sganarelle, appearing in several of
                     MoliÃ¨reâs plays in prose and verse, and often reflecting the prototype of the
                        âbourgeois de Parisâ, who isnât attuned to the new
                     society of the young reign of Louis XIV, the âmondainsâ. The
                     analysis of the results is carried out with a register perspective, with the
                     aim of identifying syntactic patterns that characterize the different
                     Sganarelles with respect to the type of context in which they find themselves
                     in the different plays. The results show how the evolution of the character can
                     be traced from his first appearance to his later uses by MoliÃ¨re.

                  This article is based upon the work of The Baudelaire Song Project, a digital
                     research project, launched in 2015, which aims to catalogue and to analyse all
                     the song settings of the poems of Charles Baudelaire. The Project seeks both to
                     increase awareness of the many musical works based on the verse poems collected
                     in Les Fleurs du Mal and the prose poems in Petits PoÃ¨mes en prose, and, crucially, to establish a
                     new digital methodology for analysing song settings of poetry, which accords
                     equal weight to text and to music. The article begins with a brief outline of
                     the Project, placing the emphasis on the way in which âdistant readingsâ of
                     song settings can pave the way for more detailed digital analyses at corpus
                     level. It details how the methodology can be applied in order to study the
                     interpretative decisions made by composers and songwriters when they set a
                     poetic text to music, making use of Sonic Visualiser. The second part of the
                     study shows the methodology in action, applying it to two song settings of
                     Baudelaireâs poem, âLa Mort des amantsâ, the first
                     composed by Claude Debussy in 1887, and the second performed by the popular
                     contemporary singer Babx, which appears on his 2015 album, Cristal automatique. The article will present the results of this
                     analysis, before concluding by considering ways to develop the methodology
                     further and identifying future possibilities for using digital techniques for
                     studying song settings of literary texts.

                     Chris Marker who passed away that year. The acquisition of Markerâs library is
                     significant because of the extent of the collection and the diversity of
                     subjects it treats. Marker created books as his system of record keeping,
                     collecting and compiling correspondence, photographs, press clippings, etc.
                     Nearly all of these elements could be linked to other documents in other
                     books.
                  The archives are not available for physical consultation to avoid putting the
                     books at risk of damage; instead, the CinÃ©mathÃ¨que decided to create a virtual

                 Collaboration has become a hallmark of Digital Humanities (DH) research.
                    Nonetheless it remains under-discussed and for those not deeply engaged in DH a
                    bit of a mystery. Drawing on recent DH work and publications that engage with
                    questions of DH collaboration in different ways (e.g. 
                    
                    ), we analyse three types of DH collaboration:
                    1) human-human interactions; 2) human-machine/material interactions; and 3)
                    machine/material-machine/material interactions. We argue that engagement with
                    collaboration processes and practices enables us to think through how DH tools
                    and practices reinforce, resist, shape, and encode material realities which both
                    pre-exist, and are co-produced by them. We suggest that understanding these
                    entanglements facilitates a critical DH in which academic hierarchies and
                    disciplinary preconceptions are challenged.

                [en]
                The William Blake Archive emphasizes accuracy and objectivity. The photographed
                    or scanned images are made faithful to their original objects in scale, color,
                    and detail. The editorsâ notes are largely bibliographic and informative. The
                    illustration descriptions consist of precise observations deliberately void of
                    interpretation. The transcriptions are as diplomatic as the digital medium
                    allows. And the explicit relationships between objects in the Archive are
                    material; one can see, for example, copies of prints from the same relief-etched
                    copper plate, or a design carried from a water color drawing to an engraved
                    illustration. The scholar must be free to make his or her own
                    interpretations.
                Since beginning to redesign the back end and front end of the site, the editors
                    and staff have realized that more kinds of relationship might be made explicit.
                    The challenge has been to decide which ones conform to our emphasis on accuracy
                    and objectivity. In a neutral presentation of art and its contextual
                    information, we canât tell the scholar that object X relates to object Y because
                    they embody the same theme. That would impose on him or her our own
                    interpretation. But we can say that X relates to Y because they contain some of
                    the same text. 
                 In this paper we discuss the difficult task of digitally presenting more kinds
                    of relationships in the Archive while staying objective. We explain how the task
                    has compelled us to reevaluate Blakeâs methods and reencode the connections
                    amongst his works accordingly. We describe planned enhancements to our tools
                    used for representing and displaying these connections--enhancements that would
                    benefit all archives, not just the Blake Archive. And finally we gesture towards
                    further research into the philosophical context of Blake's practice of making
                    related art and into the idea of relationship in archives in general.

                Even if digitized and born-digital audiovisual material today amounts to a
                    steadily increasing body of data to work with and research, such media
                    modalities are still relatively poorly represented in the field of DH. Streaming
                    media is a case in point, and the purpose of this article is to provide some
                    findings from an ongoing audio (and music) research project, that deals with
                    experiments, interventions and the reverse engineering of Spotifyâs algorithms,
                    aggregation procedures, and valuation strategies. One such research experiment,
                    the SpotiBot intervention, was set up at Humlab, UmeÃ¥ University. Via multiple
                    bots running in parallel our idea was to examine if it is possible to provoke â
                    or even undermine â the Spotify business model (based on the so called
                        â30 second royalty ruleâ). Essentially, the experiment
                    resembled a Turing test, where we asked ourselves what happens when â not if â
                    streaming bots approximate human listener behavior in such a way that it becomes
                    impossible to distinguish between a human and a machine. Implemented in the
                    Python programming language, and using a web UI testing frameworks, our so
                    called SpotiBot engine automated the Spotify web client by simulating user
                    interaction within the web interface. The SpotiBot engine was instructed to play
                    a single track repeatedly (both self-produced music and Abbaâs ""Dancing Queen""),
                    during less and more than 30 seconds, and with a fixed repetition scheme running
                    from 100 to n times (simultaneously with different
                    Spotify Free âbot accountsâ). Our bots also logged all results. In short, our
                    bots demonstrated the ability (at least sometimes) to continuously play tracks,
                    indicating that the Spotify business model can be tampered with. Using a single
                    virtual machine â hidden behind only one proxy IP â the results of the
                    intervention hence stipulate that it is possible to automatically play tracks
                    for thousands of repetitions that exceeds the royalty rule.

                    further inform us about the regional, temporal, and dialectical contexts in
                    which they existed. The addition of this research to the wider literature on the

                Thomas Paine's Rights of Man (Part I, 1791; Part II,
                    1792) is one of the most influential political tracts ever written. Recently,
                    Clark (2015) has queried the long-established notion that Part I is the work of
                    a single author, Paine himself. Clark argues that a passage of approximately
                    6000 words just prior to the âDeclaration of the Rights of
                        Man and Citizensâ, near midway through the book, was written by
                    Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette, and inserted by Paine into his book,
                    perhaps with some editing. Clark's assertion rests mainly on judgement of the
                    tone and content of the queried passage, as well as a hint in a letter by
                    Lafayette to George Washington. This paper presents the results of a stylometric
                    study of this question. Three computational approaches to stylistic analysis â
                    one involving a consensus of six attribution techniques â were applied to the
                    text of the Rights of Man, Part I, along with a
                    corpus of comparison texts from the same period. Our findings tend to
                    corroborate Clark's contention, as well as identifying two other short passages
                    in which Lafayette may have had a hand, thus rendering this important document

                    reorganized how we think about and physically do our work in the social sciences
                    and humanities. Some new methodologies enabled by digital media are obvious and
                    others just emerging. A major shift that digital media have enabled is
                    dethroning close reading as the gold-standard methodology in the humanities and
                    augmenting it with hyper and machine reading. Haylesâs argument has far-reaching
                    implications for the social sciences and humanities, but those implications
                    expand much further when we consider that digital media often represents

                    problems faced by many online cultural heritage collections. These problems are
                    lack of accessibility, limited functionalities to explore the collection through
                    browsing, and risk of less known content being overlooked. The object of our

                    of folktales from the Netherlands. Although this collection was designed as a

                    using both computational and traditional means. The central question this
                    article addresses is: Did Coca-Cola advertisements in Dutch newspapers
                    communicate themes that represented the American way of life? Using two separate

                [en]
                
                In the emerging field of digital style analysis, scholars have been dwelling on a
                    perceived irreconcilability of âdistant readingâ
                     and âclose readingâ
                    
                    . This situation is somewhat reminiscent of the
                        âparadigm warsâ in social science, where for years, one
                    could either adhere to a quantitative or a qualitative mindset. Taking seriously
                    both the hermeneutic and the empirical traditions of (digital) stylistic
                    research, the present paper proposes âa mixed-methodsâ
                    coalition of approaches. To establish links between the mixed-methods paradigm
                    from Social Sciences  and stylistic practices
                    within Digital Humanities (DH), the present article discusses common methods of
                    distant, close, and âscalable readingâ as well as a flexibly adjustable
                    definition of style . In the practical part of the
                    paper, I report a âmixed-methods digital stylisticsâ study on Franz Kafkaâs
                    prose. Scaling the degree of abstraction and contextuality of the data according
                    to particular research questions, I combine (1) âquantitative
                        hypothesis testingâ (examining Kafkaâs stylistic
                        âuniquenessâ by means of a stylometric measure); (2)
                        âquantitative explorationâ (analyzing the first hundred
                    statistically overrepresented words in Kafka); and (3) âqualitative
                        text analysisâ (KWIC and close reading to investigate the
                    functions of a particular style marker in the context of Kafkaâs The Judgment [Das
                    Urteil]). Generally, for digital stylistics, I propose (a) raising
                    epistemological and methodological awareness within the field, and (b) framing
                    the research within the mixed-method paradigm that in fact seems very well
                    suited to DH.

                We investigate what distinguishes reported dreams from other personal narratives.
                    The continuity hypothesis, stemming from psychological dream
                    analysis work, states that most dreams refer to a personâs daily life and
                    personal concerns, similar to other personal narratives such as diary entries.
                    Differences between the two texts may reveal the linguistic markers of dream
                    text, which could be the basis for new dream analysis work and for the automatic
                    detection of dream descriptions. We used three text analytics methods: text
                    classification, topic modeling, and text coherence analysis, and applied these
                    methods to a balanced set of texts representing dreams, diary entries, and other
                    personal stories. We observed that dream texts could be distinguished from other
                    personal narratives nearly perfectly, mostly based on the presence of
                    uncertainty markers and descriptions of scenes. Important markers for non-dream
                    narratives are specific time expressions. Dream texts also exhibit a lower
                    discourse coherence than other personal narratives.

                This article presents a new model for emotion mining, resulting from the research
                    project âEmbodied Emotionsâ. This project aims: 1. to trace
                    historical changes in emotion expression and in the embodiment of emotions, and
                    2. to develop methods to trace these changes in sizeable corpuses of digitized
                    texts. Up to now, the mining of sentiments or emotions has mainly been
                    restricted to modern, or even very recent text corpora, such as social media.
                    Sentiment mining techniques are often based on relatively simple emotion models
                    of binary (positive/negative) oppositions, or limited sets of âbasicâ emotions
                    and are not yet able to deal adequately with the complexity and the historical
                    contingency of emotions and their expression. To meet these challenges, we have
                    developed the Historic Embodied Emotion Model (HEEM), built on a test case of 29
                    Dutch language theatre plays written between 1600 and 1800 and annotated
                    manually with HEEM labels for emotions and body terms. In this article, we
                    present this model and compare it with other sentiment mining techniques: 1) off
                    the shelf linguistic analysis software LIWC (Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count),
                    2) a version of LIWC that has been adapted for the analysis of Dutch historical
                    texts, 3) a new Dutch translation of WordNetAffect. We conclude that, although
                    different forms of sentiment mining have their value and use, HEEM provides new
                    opportunities for emotion mining and analysis of embodied emotions in historical
                    texts.

                This paper analyzes the design space for crafting systems within games. A
                    crafting system is the collection of game mechanics which enable a player to
                    create virtual objects within a game, with examples ranging from making a
                    pickaxe or placing blocks in Minecraft, to
                    combining ingredients to create items in World of
                        Warcraft, or designing a city in SimCity. Within both game design and game journalism there is no
                    systematic understanding of what crafting means in games â rather, the term is
                    used in an informal âIâll know it when I see itâ way, with
                    different ideas of what constitutes âcraftingâ becoming
                    conventional for different game genres. We aim to create a more systematic
                    analysis and language for virtual crafting, using a design space approach where
                    we identify seven features of crafting systems; any given crafting system is
                    understood in terms of the degree and manner in which it exemplifies these
                    features. The features we identify are: recipe definition (how well-defined are
                    the player steps for creating a virtual object), fidelity of action (how
                    detailed is the player-performed enactment of crafting), completion constraints
                    (how is creation constrained by virtual âresourcesâ),
                    variable outcome (how much can the result vary when the player performs the same
                    crafting actions), system recognition of outcome (to what degree do other game
                    systems âunderstandâ and take account of what a player has
                    made), player expressiveness (how big is the creative space provided to the
                    player), and progression (how do the possibilities of crafting change over
                    time). We apply these dimensions to the analysis of 64 crafting systems across
                    47 example games. This more systematic analysis of the crafting system design
                    space provides a deeper understanding of how games function as a creative and
                    artistic medium for players, and provides a language and framework enabling
                    scholars, critics and developers to more deeply understand existing crafting
                    systems as well as unexplored opportunities for future crafting systems.

                The past twenty years have witnessed a mounting crisis in academic publishing.
                    Companies such as Reed-Elsevier, Wiley-Blackwell, and Taylor and Francis have
                    earned unprecedented profits by controlling more and more scholarly output while
                    increasing subscription rates to academic journals. Thus publishers have

                    would disperse control over knowledge production. Open access initiatives dating
                    back to the mid-1990s evidence a religious zeal for overcoming corporate

                        archivangelism. Little attention has been given to the legacy
                    or implications of religious rhetoric in open access debates despite its
                    increasing pitch in recent years. This essay shows how the Protestant imaginary
                    reconcilesârather than opposesâopen access initiatives with market economics by
                    tracing the rhetoric of openness to free-market liberalism. Working against the
                    tendency to accept the Reformation as an analogy for the relationship between
                    knowledge production, publishers, and academics, we read Protestantism as a
                    counterproductive element of the archivangelist inheritance.

                Over the last few years, the Perseus Digital Library (PDL) and the Open Philology

                    standard and the Epidoc subset of the TEI P5 guidelines. This is a
                    resource-intensive effort necessitating a scalable workflow centered on

                Discussions of digital humanities pedagogy have often focused on discussions of
                        âscaffoldingâ and âplayâ
                    (alternatively, âtinkeringâ) approaches, and methods for
                    assessing student work appropriate to both techniques. While these approaches
                    may seem oppositional, we emphasize the need to balance them in most classroom
                    contexts, and explore challenges with integrating new digital humanities
                    platforms in topically-driven humanities classrooms. We examine our experiences
                    as an instructor and a librarian partnering to include a multimedia publishing
                    assignment sequence in a course on the history of childrenâs literature, and our
                    assessment of our approach to instruction in a distance graduate education
                    context that is not amenable to the âlabâ-based learning
                    usually used in person for DH learning. While discussions of assessment of DH
                    classroom projects generally focus on the question of how to grade student work,
                    we argue that assessment is as important for reflecting on and evaluating
                    pedagogy, including how to balance and iteratively improve
                        âscaffoldingâ and âplayâ approaches.
                    These issues are important not just for experienced DH instructors, but also

                Recent years have seen widespread interest in digital humanities (DH) and growing
                    interest in undergraduate-centered digital curricula. However, few undergraduate
                    DH programs resemble those at large research institutions, where digital
                    initiatives tend to be housed in graduate programs and rooted in graduate
                    pedagogy or faculty research. Further, no two undergraduate DH programs are
                    alike. This article seeks to move beyond graduate- and faculty-centered models
                    by exploring new possibilities for undergraduate DH initiatives. It describes a
                    workshop held at the ADHO DH2015 conference. This workshop brought together
                    practitioners of digital pedagogy from small liberal arts colleges and from
                    undergraduate centers within larger institutions. This article details the
                    workshopâs exploration of undergraduate DH education, situating those practices
                    in the context of broader trends in digital pedagogy. Finally, this article
                    charts three broad challenges faced by programs which emphasize undergraduate
                    digital curricula and offers suggestions and strategies to address these common

                Digital humanities projects and methods are becoming increasingly common in
                    undergraduate humanities classrooms. Digital projects and exercises allow
                    students to engage with new technology, collaborate with peers, graduate
                    students, and faculty, and produce tangible scholarship that is publicly
                    visible. The Lab for the Education and Advancement in Digital Research (LEADR),
                    a new student-focused digital humanities initiative at Michigan State
                    University, has introduced digital components into large numbers of of History
                    and Anthropology courses. Through two years of courses, it has proven fruitful
                    to frame these not as âDigital Humanities projects,â but as
                    part of a digital liberal arts curriculum that seeks to teach students not only
                    about the domain-specific content, but also essential skills for information
                    retrieval and analysis, media literacy, and communication in the digital age.
                    This framework places these skills as extensions of longstanding skills,
                    literacies, and knowledges that humanities and social sciences have contributed
                    towards liberal arts education.

                Since 2014, The Map of Early Modern London (MoEML) has partnered with professors and students
                    around the world in a unique collaboration between a digital humanities (DH)
                    project and humanities classrooms. The model we have developed addresses a
                    sustainability challenge for DH projects, provides professors with a way of
                    meeting administrative demands for engaged learning, and gives students a
                    high-stakes research-based learning opportunity with the potential for an
                    open-access, peerâreviewed publication. The MoEML
                    Pedagogical Partnership Project emerged from a confluence of problems and
                    opportunities. One longstanding problem for DH practitioners is project-based:
                    how do we sustain the projects already begun? Another problem emerges as DH
                    moves out of the âbig tentâ and sets up camp in humanities
                    classrooms at smaller, non-R1 institutions. Also, for scholars not trained in
                    the technologies that drive many DH projects, crossing the analog-digital divide
                    might be daunting and discourage them from contributing to DH projects. To
                    address these challenges, the MoEML Pedagogical
                    Partnership takes Research-Based Learning (RBL) models and turns them into
                    high-profile publication opportunities, mobilizing ubiquitous social networking
                    and communication technologies to connect the project with the new demographic
                    of student contributors. This essay will highlight how digital projects and
                    digi-curious professors can collaborate to develop innovative pedagogical
                    practices that provide projects with content, enliven professorsâ pedagogy, and
                    invite students to acquire scholarly research skills, gain digital literacy, and
                    engage in an interdisciplinary and international collaboration. We argue that DH
                    projects can be used innovatively and effectively in the classroom to promote
                    RBL. At the same time, DH projectsâopen-access ones in particularâcan provide a
                    home both for humanities research and for the fruits of digital pedagogy across
                    a wide range of institutional settings.

                How can alternate histories of DH through feminist criticism, participatory art,
                    and design shape undergraduate pedagogy in DH? In this article, we argue for
                    explicitly employing a âscholar-citizenâ model as a principle
                    of pedagogical design, making explicit many of the latent assumptions of DH
                    belonging and community. By adhering to these design principles we have been
                    able to question some of the assumptions of pedagogical theories like Research
                    Based Learning and publicâfacing scholarship, demonstrating these theoriesâ
                    complex relationships public, semiâpublic, or private dissemination; classroom
                    and nonâclassroom spaces; complexity of the assigned task; and the role of
                    assessment. Our experiences as Director and Assistant Director for a combined

                Digital Humanities (DH) methods incorporated into traditional (non-DH) humanities
                    classrooms present a fruitful opportunity to help undergraduate students learn
                    digital literacy skills as well as new ways of studying the humanities. In light
                    of the trend of increasing numbers of women entering higher education and
                    choosing humanities and arts degrees, DH can also help women who potentially
                    face gender biases related to digital technology gain competence and confidence
                    with it through their humanities courses. Having more students introduced to DH
                    as a regular part of study may increase diversity in the DH community when they
                    themselves become teachers and researchers. Barriers exist, from reluctance to
                    change to a rising contingent labor force. Therefore, this article offers a
                    selection of accessible DH methods that can be used to positively shape
                    humanities pedagogy.

                 This essay presents an approach to teaching Digital Humanities through two
                    largely unexplored lenses: electronic literature and foreign languages (Spanish
                    in particular). It offers a practical example of a course taught during the
                    Spring of 2016 at UC Berkeley that combines literary analysis with the teaching
                    of basic programming skills, and DH tools and methods. Concretely, this course
                    is an upper division, undergraduate writing intensive class, where students
                    learn how to write and talk about electronic literatureâe.g. hypertext novels,
                    kinetic poetry, automatic generators, social media fictions, etc.â, learning
                    specific terminology and theoretical frameworks, as they gain the skills to
                    build their own digital art pieces in a collaborative workshop setting. By
                    taking this course as a practical example, this essay tackles three important
                    pillars in the humanities. Firstly, the overall concept of literature, and more
                    specifically, the literary; secondly, what we understand by literary studies at
                    the university; and thirdly, and more broadly, what constitutes cultural (beyond
                    technical) literacy in the twentyâfirst century. This essayâs final claim is
                    that teaching e-it as DH effectively address all three.

                    collaborate in debates and projects. Introducing DH in the academic programs at
                    an undergraduate level can be a difficult path to traverse. Even so, for the
                    academic year 2016, we managed to include a Specialized Seminar-Workshop on this

                Despite the perceived newness of electronic methods in physical classrooms,
                    electricityâand the distributed labor on which it runsâhas long powered the
                    spaces of pedagogy. Routing electronic practices in undergraduate teaching

                    circuits of power that migrate between disciplinary and physical learning
                    systems. It does so through a discussion of Pedagogy Toolkit, an open source and
                    community-authored teaching repository built with Jekyll and deployed via GitHub
                    Pages. Contributing to an increase of energy for project-based interventions in
                    digital humanities teaching, Pedagogy Toolkit circulates digitized teaching
                    materials, guides to teaching with digital humanities tools, a curated sample of
                    online syllabuses accompanied by a syllabus templating tool, and an accessible
                    website templating framework. An overview of new methods for digital teaching in

                    design of digital platforms as pedagogical objects, activating issues of labor,
                    diversity, and knowledge transmission along the way. Ultimately, building a
                    toolkit for digital pedagogy constructs infrastructure as a mode of intellectual
                    inquiry, exposing classroom power as a conduit for ethical connections between
                    students, teachers, and digital development teams. Rerouting logics that

                In the Fall of 2015, I was hired as contract academic staff at Wilfrid Laurier
                    Universityâs Department of English and Film Studies to teach the foundation
                    course EN245 âThe English Literary Tradition (Beginnings to
                        1660)â for the first time as a course with a heavy DH component. My
                    paper is a case study investigating the challenges of creating and delivering a
                    partially online course in a university environment where the majority of
                    teaching is done by sessional instructors whose labour is systemically
                    marginalized by administration. Sessional instructors (or âeducational
                        entrepreneursâ) have even more limited resources (in terms of
                    time, access to technical support, and access to administration) than tenure
                    track faculty; however, open-access educational tools arenât serving merely to
                    level the playing field, but reshape it altogether as technical support and
                    access to administrative support cease to matter in the delivery of an
                    educational product. Today, many of the tools that are sufficient for the
                    creation of a successful online or partially online course, whether generalist -
                    iTunesU, Zotero, YouTube - or specialist - Google NGram, the University of
                    Victoria`s Map of Early Modern London, Internet Shakespeare Editions - are
                    freely available to instructors.
                Such freely available tools problematize the relationship between the instructor
                    and the university insofar as universities tend to use proprietary systems (e.g.
                    Desire2Learn) for everything, including data management, presentation,
                    communication, and gradebook integration with the registrarâs office.
                    Universities, in insisting on using these universal proprietary systems for
                    every aspect of course delivery, exacerbate the disenfranchisement of sessional
                    instructors, as access to the support required to become experts in these tools
                    is limited and taken on at the instructorâs cost. A sessional instructor can
                    create an entire course using freely available online tools, at minimal cost and
                    reaching a tremendously large and diverse audience, yet cannot then market that
                    course to any university that has a similar course as an educational product. At
                    the present moment, the sessional instructor and the course are both subject to
                    the curriculum of an individual university and department, despite the fact that
                    courses with a heavy DH component tend towards portability, interoperability,
                    and modularity that renders such boundaries largely incoherent. Though there are
                    attempts to provide funding for courses that will bridge interuniversity
                    boundaries such as the $4.5 million put forward by the Ontario Ministry of
                    Training, Colleges and Universities as a part of the eCampus Ontario initiative,
                    such funding models largely exclude the sessional instructor, who cannot apply
                    for funding as an âeducational entrepreneur.â My paper will
                    tell the story of how I tried to navigate a university system that tried to keep
                    me from using free tools, while at the same time promoting my course as a part
                    of the eCampus Ontario initiative.

                The need for organising and digitally processing the vast amount of Cultural
                    Heritage (CH) information has recently led to the development of formal
                    knowledge representation models (ontologies) for the CH domain. Existing models,
                    however, do not capture gender-related concepts. This article presents an effort
                    to fill this gap by developing a new ontology for the representation of gendered
                    concepts in CH resources. The new ontology, named âGenderedCHContentsâ resulted from combined research in womenâs
                    studies, gender theory, and computer science. Its primary aim is to draw
                    attention to the presence of women within CH artefacts. The proposed ontology
                    extends the Europeana Data Model (EDM) with twenty-two new classes, sixteen
                    object properties and seven datatype properties. The article presents a
                    demonstration of the âGenderedCHContentsâ ontologyâs
                    use in five different representation tasks, which describe five resources
                    related to Pandoraâs myth. Lastly, the study stresses the benefits of reasoning
                    support (i.e. enabling computers to infer further information from a set of
                    asserted facts) in revealing different gender ideals and inferred relationships
                    between metaphorical concepts, along with the benefits of the Semantic Web in
                    making information about gendered contents more easily retrievable to the
                    users.

                            constitutive of individualsâ lives in such a way that their development
                            also fosters that of the strength of the stateâ
                        
                    . This article takes Foucaultâs insight as a point of departure for
                    thinking about how digital technologies are mediating and structuring the
                    relationships between individuals and organizations, using the European
                    Commission-funded Europeana project as a case study. Europeana is the embodiment
                    of all and each as a technique of government: it functions by fostering the
                    contributions of individuals and national audiences in a way that celebrates
                    their diversity, while also engaging in a project to systematically standardize
                    and unify. Examination of the technical elements of Europeana reveals the
                    political imperatives implicit in its technical operations, and how the
                    parameters for audience participation are subsequently defined. In this article,
                    we examine the audiences explicitly and implicitly delimited by Europeana, and
                    then analyze them in relation to the projectâs development of the European Data
                    Model (EDM) for the interchange of metadata about cultural heritage objects. The
                    article concludes that a lack of explicit definitions about audiences, what
                    Europeana is, and how its various parts work in concert constitute a
                        definitional void. This void is a technique of government in
                    that it absorbs difference and is deliberately vague. It involves power
                    relations that are hard to center and render visible, and it is thus difficult
                    to detect which actors are occupying a space of privilege. We suggest some
                    tentative strategies for addressing this problem by attending to the sites of
                    awkward engagement and difference that are currently masked in the technical
                    framing of Europeana.

                    1978 under the direction of Professor Ben R. Schneider, Jr. at Lawrence
                    University. With support from the National Endowment for the Humanities, the
                    American Council of Learned Societies, and the Mellon Foundation, Schneiderâs
                    team produced a database from the multi-volume reference work The London Stage 1660-1800 (Southern Illinois
                    University Press, 1960-68). Today, however, most of the projectâs outputs are
                    lost or damaged, and its history has been largely forgotten in both theater
                    studies and eighteenth-century studies. This essay traces the history of the
                    Information Bank and my efforts to recover its damaged data and code, offering
                    the project as an object lesson in questions of access, preservation, and
                    institutional memory that digital humanities practitioners continue to confront
                    in 2017. I argue that the project faded into obscurity, not only because of
                    technological obsolescence, but also because the development team was unable to
                    promote the kinds of research questions and behaviors that would enable their
                    tool's widespread adoption and survival. The indifference of literary and
                    theater scholars to the Information Bank throughout
                    the late 1970s and early 1980s demonstrates how vital it is that digital and
                    computational humanities work articulate its meaningfulness within existing
                    intellectual and disciplinary traditions. While digital scholars build new
                    avenues for inquiry that expand and transform humanities research, the survival
                    of these approaches depends on their relationship to current humanities
                    questions, methods, commitments, and epistemologies.

                    Introducing GALGO (Golden Age Literature Glossary
                    Online) ","Abstract
                [en]
                
                This paper describes a digital teaching application that approaches the study of
                    language and literary works from a social semiotic perspective and represents an
                    innovative pedagogical model for world language and literature classes. The
                    Golden Age Literature Glossary Online, known by the acronym GALGO, consists of an online glossary of select keywords, from
                    canonical texts of Golden Age Spanish literature, whose multiple connotations
                    illuminate important linguistic and social concepts of the 16th and 17th
                    centuries. GALGO incorporates British cultural
                    historian Raymond Williamsâ methodology in his Keywords: A
                        Vocabulary of Culture and Society: namely, identifying problem-laden
                    words or âkeywords,â charting their
                    distinct usages across texts, and reflecting critically on clusters of
                    associated words. GALGO seeks to instantiate
                    language as social semiotic by linking the semantic configurations of a literary
                    work simultaneously to the cultural environment, the linguistic system, and the
                    social system. Applying the conceptual design of M.A.K. Hallidayâs social
                    semiotic model, GALGOâs interpretive apparatus
                    provides the field of discourse or context of situation
                    for the text in which a specific keyword appears. The field of
                        discourse presents clusters, word groupings of semiotic affinity that
                    describe the social action that is taking place in the text. GALGO also performs an interpretation of the tenor of discourse, highlighting sociological variables
                    connected to class status, gender role and racial category that refine a
                    keywordâs meaning from the perspective of interpersonal relationships. Finally,
                        GALGO adds commentary on
                    discursive structures, such as patterns of grammar, syntactic nuances, and
                    figurative language, that surround the keyword in the text.
                GALGOâs strength resides in the synchronic
                    connectivity that the system facilitates when identifying the constellation of
                    meanings for any given keyword. From a technical perspective, the system has the
                    ability to efficiently identify the absolute position of all uses of a keyword
                    across multiple texts, so that large texts can be managed and search times
                    minimized for both users and system administrators. GALGO is constructed in such a way that users can not only access
                    existing analysis within the database, but also can assume, when instructed to
                    do so, the role of the system administrator and contribute their own
                    annotations. A team of faculty and student administrators are currently building
                    the database with research previously collected in Spanish Golden Age literature
                    seminars. Providence College students have utilized the social semiotic
                    methodology underlying GALGO for several years now
                    with successful outcomes both in terms of their growth as language majors and
                    critical thinkers.

                    cause trauma. I bring together several critical strandsâmost importantly visual
                    culture, race theory, and archival scienceâto question how the structure of a

                Named Entity Recognition (NER), search, classification and tagging of names and
                    name-like informational elements in texts, has become a standard information
                    extraction procedure for textual data. NER has been applied to many types of
                    texts and different types of entities: newspapers, fiction, historical records,
                    persons, locations, chemical compounds, protein families, animals etc. In
                    general, the performance of a NER system is genre- and domain-dependent and also
                    used entity categories vary . The most general set of
                    named entities is usually some version of a tripartite categorization of
                    locations, persons, and organizations. In this paper we report trials and
                    evaluation of NER with data from a digitized Finnish historical newspaper
                    collection (Digi). Experiments, results, and discussion of this research serve
                    development of the web collection of historical Finnish newspapers. 
                Digi collection contains 1,960,921 pages of newspaper material from
                    1771â1910 in both Finnish and Swedish. We use only material of Finnish documents
                    in our evaluation. The OCRed newspaper collection has lots of OCR errors; its
                    estimated word level correctness is about 70â75 % .
                    Our principal NE tagger is a rule-based tagger of Finnish, FiNER,
                    provided by the FIN-CLARIN consortium. We also show results of limited category
                    semantic tagging with tools of the Semantic Computing Research Group (SeCo) of the Aalto University.
                    Three other tools are also evaluated briefly.
                This paper reports the first large scale results of NER in a historical Finnish
                    OCRed newspaper collection. Results of this research supplement NER results of
                    other languages with similar noisy data. As the results are also achieved with a
                    small and morphologically rich language, they illuminate the relatively
                    well-researched area of Named Entity Recognition from a new perspective.

                    to character creation mechanics. First, Lisa Nakamuraâs identity tourism and
                    narratological constructs are applied to formalize the concept of the
                    exploration in digital narratives. Second, exploration of gender and sexual
                    identities is demonstrated through a queer narratological analysis of two
                    digital narratives, Always Sometimes Monsters

                    toward progressive game designs. Concerns regarding a sexuality blind approach
                    and the downplaying of homophobia are addressed, and Helene Cixousâs

                There has been much discussion about digital humanities (DH) both as a discipline
                    and as a community of practice. This paper is based on my talk given to open the
                        Leipzig eHumanities Seminar series and is presented here with many thanks to
                        the organisers for their kind and generous invitation. Thanks also to the
                        DHQ reviewers whose valuable comments have helped me to strengthen this
                        paper. Whatever the balance of opinion, the emergence
                    of digital scholarship in the humanities has undoubtedly had considerable impact
                    on many disciplines; one such discipline is Classics and the study of the
                    ancient world more generally. This article uses the Digital Classicist (DC) as
                    an example of a DH community in a case study which traces its development and
                    growth to examine what might be learned. As a community the DC joins together
                    practitioners interested in the application of innovative digital methods and
                    technology to the study of the ancient world (in its widest sense). How has this
                    come about and perhaps more importantly, how has it been sustained and indeed
                    provided the inspiration for other affiliated communities? What do we understand
                    by a community and the association of individual practitioners separated by
                    distance? It is important that members feel that they are stakeholders, that
                    they have a sense of ownership and derive value from participation and
                    contribution. It is argued here that a community could be seen as a symbolic and
                    intellectual construct, one of perception rather than physicality to facilitate
                    the exchange of ideas and so effect growth and strengthen the discipline.

                The formally constrained work of the Oulipo (lâOuvroir de LittÃ©rature
                    Potentielle, loosely translated as Workshop of Potential Literature) lends
                    itself particularly well to digital studies, which was quickly recognized by the
                    members of the group. To facilitate its goal of avoiding chance in its literary
                    production, the group was naturally drawn to the determinism of computers, where
                    true chance is simply impossible. In its early years, therefore, the group used
                    algorithmic procedures as a starting point for various texts and also attempted
                    to program these texts on actual computers, creating some of the first
                    electronic literature and embarking on proto-digital humanities work as early as
                    the 1960s and 1970s, later abandoning these efforts and relegating all
                    subsequent activity to a subsidiary group.
                To understand the Oulipo's forays into computer science and more importantly, why
                    they abandoned them, I designed and carried out one of the inaugural projects of
                    the Princeton Center for Digital Humanities. The goal was twofold: first,
                    through exploratory programming, I intended to create interactive, digital
                    annexes to accompany my doctoral dissertation; more importantly, I hoped that by
                    attempting to reproduce the Oulipo's own algorithmic efforts, I would gain
                    similar insights into the nature of âPotential Literatureâ and be able to
                    understand why the group abandoned such efforts after the 1970s.
                This article describes the content, development, and results of my project. For
                    each of my three Python-based annexes, I offer a historical survey of the
                    Oulipian text or procedure discussed within and the Oulipoâs own proto-digital
                    humanities experiments; then, I will talk about my own experiences as a
                    coder-researcher, what learning Python has brought to my project, and how my
                    exploratory programming offered me a new kind of critical reflection.
                    Establishing these annexes forced me to learn to code, a type of work that does
                    not only produce digital texts, but also helped me to reflect on the notion of
                    chance in a more nuanced way. Finally, coding has allowed me to better
                    understand the Oulipian mentality concerning this sort of digital
                    experimentation.

                Interdisciplinary collaboration brings the benefit of multiple perspectives to a
                    research project, yet it also provides opportunities for reflection on each
                    disciplineâs knowledge base. This article presents a case study in
                    interdisciplinary collaboration between two disparate fields, web development
                    and anthropology. We explore the challenges of translating between domains with
                    differing values, aims and methodologies, as well as issues that arose for us
                    during the development of a web application designed to provide a digital output
                    of an ethnographic project. We consider our experience using the Agile style of
                    software development, which emphasises rapid prototyping, iteration and even
                    failure. In the long run, we find negative experiences in web development can be
                    more valuable than the positive ones. The concept of âknowledge brokerageâ is a
                    useful term to describe the collaboration between the academics â who were
                    forced to conceptualise their data in new ways â and the developer â who
                    negotiated these transitions between abstract information and binary data, and
                    between academia and a public-facing web application.

                [en]
        The concept of literary genre is a highly complex one: not only are different genres
          frequently defined on several, but not necessarily the same levels of description, but
          consideration of genres as cognitive, social, or scholarly constructs with a rich history
          further complicate the matter. This contribution focuses on thematic aspects of genre with
          a quantitative approach, namely Topic Modeling. Topic Modeling has proven to be useful to
          discover thematic patterns and trends in large collections of texts, with a view to class
          or browse them on the basis of their dominant themes. It has rarely if ever, however, been
          applied to collections of dramatic texts.
        In this contribution, Topic Modeling is used to analyze a collection of French Drama of
          the Classical Age and the Enlightenment. The general aim of this contribution is to
          discover what semantic types of topics are found in this collection, whether different
          dramatic subgenres have distinctive dominant topics and plot-related topic patterns, and
          inversely, to what extent clustering methods based on topic scores per play produce
          groupings of texts which agree with more conventional genre distinctions. This
          contribution shows that interesting topic patterns can be detected which provide new
          insights into the thematic, subgenre-related structure of French drama as well as into the
          history of French drama of the Classical Age and the Enlightenment.

                    hundred years, many geo-human factors caused radical changes in the region. In a
                    landscape almost untouched for centuries, the signs of the interactions between
                    the ancient human communities and the natural environment were much clearer in

                In this paper we intend to present a tool we developed for translation studies
                    and diachronically compare various French translations of the Odyssey. 
                This field of study is part of the more general âClassical Receptionsâ
                    studies that try to analyse the influence and adaptation of classical texts in
                    modern and contemporary literature, theatre, cinema, and many other artistic
                    fields. While Greek texts have been analysed by scholars for more than two
                    thousand years, research about classical translations is not yet a most renown
                    subject. In recent years this theme has raised a growing interest in the
                    academic community. 
                We developed a program that can align textual sequences (defined as groups of
                    words delimited by a specified grammatical pivot, in our case proper nouns),
                    without need of previous training. We obtained alignments for many different
                    kinds of translationsEven free translations, a problem that wasnât
                        generally considered by textual aligners since recent studies. While
                    other programs have an upper bound for one-to-many alignments (for example with

                    algorithm allows an indefinite number of alignments, both for the source
                    sequences and the target ones. The aligner is based on an implementation of
                    Needleman-Wunsch algorithm and on a string-based similarity approach to textual
                    segments. The aligner needs to establish proper names as anchor words, as they
                    are a relatively stable feature through different translations and tend to be
                    similar in several languages. 
                Thanks to the alignments obtained using the program, we can explore translations
                    in a number of ways. We will illustrate the creation of a graphical interface to
                    visualize French Homeric translations. 
                With our tool, it is possible to highlight aligned portions of texts and show
                    their immediate differences or similarities, both in meaning and in syntactic
                    distribution. 
                We will show some resulting syntactic analyses carried out on a small sample of
                    texts, taken from a corpus of twenty-seven unabridged French translations of the
                    Odyssey and explore how the study of diachronic translations through algorithms
                    of computational linguistics can produce interesting results for literary and
                    linguistic studies.

            The question of how to model similarity between gestures plays an important role in
               current studies in the domain of human communication. Most research into recurrent
               patterns in co-verbal gestures â manual communicative movements emerging
               spontaneously during conversation â is driven by qualitative analyses relying on
               observational comparisons between gestures. Due to the fact that these kinds of
               gestures are not bound to well-formedness conditions, however, we propose a
               quantitative approach consisting of a distance-based similarity model for gestures
               recorded and represented in motion capture data streams. To this end, we model
               gestures by flexible feature representations, namely gesture signatures, which are
               then compared via signature-based distance functions such as the Earth Mover's
               Distance and the Signature Quadratic Form Distance. Experiments on real
               conversational motion capture data evidence the appropriateness of the proposed
               approaches in terms of their accuracy and efficiency. Our contribution to gesture
               similarity research and gesture data analysis allows for new quantitative methods of
               identifying patterns of gestural movements in human face-to-face interaction, i.e.,
               in complex multimodal data sets.

                This article describes the results of a case study that applies Neural
                    Network-based Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to scanned images of books
                    printed between 1487 and 1870 by training the OCR engine OCRopus  on the RIDGES herbal text corpus  (in press). Training specific OCR models was
                    possible because the necessary ground truth is available as
                    error-corrected diplomatic transcriptions. The OCR results have been evaluated
                    for accuracy against the ground truth of unseen test sets. Character and word
                    accuracies (percentage of correctly recognized items) for the resulting
                    machine-readable texts of individual documents range from 94% to more than 99%
                    (character level) and from 76% to 97% (word level). This includes the earliest
                    printed books, which were thought to be inaccessible by OCR methods until
                    recently. Furthermore, OCR models trained on one part of the corpus consisting
                    of books with different printing dates and different typesets (mixed
                        models) have been tested for their predictive power on the books from
                    the other part containing yet other fonts, mostly yielding character accuracies
                    well above 90%. It therefore seems possible to construct generalized models
                    trained on a range of fonts that can be applied to a wide variety of historical
                    printings still giving good results. A moderate postcorrection effort of some
                    pages will then enable the training of individual models with even better
                    accuracies. Using this method, diachronic corpora including early printings can
                    be constructed much faster and cheaper than by manual transcription. The OCR
                    methods reported here open up the possibility of transforming our printed
                    textual cultural heritage into electronic text by largely automatic means, which
                    is a prerequisite for the mass conversion of scanned books.

                    interdisciplinary research project that involved a cultural heritage foundation,
                    art historians, designers, and computer scientists. The case study examines the
                    potential of visualization when applied to, and developed for, cultural heritage
                    collections. It specifically explores how techniques aimed at visualizing the

                We propose that network visualization is a digital humanities method that can
                        âexploreâ and ânegotiateâ the space
                    between text and performance in the study of Shakespeare. The networks developed
                    in this project use the language of Shakespearean plays to trace the
                    relationships between characters in space, in effect, translating the literary
                    text into a web of spatial relations, which are difficult to perceive solely in
                    the act of reading. Our analysis presents a particular method of network
                    visualization, and also demonstrates how this technique can be used as a
                    critical tool to revise our understanding of social disorder in Shakespearean
                    tragedy. We therefore propose a dual scope for this paper. At a methodological
                    level, we argue that network visualization is a way to infer staging and the
                        âblockingâ of theatrical space from the language of the
                    playtext. In our case study, we show how this technique can be used as a form of
                    Shakespearean literary criticism deploying this method to reframe the larger
                    question of social disorder in his tragedies. The network visualizations used in
                    this analysis serve as a stable and reproducible way, beyond any single
                    performance, to delineate how the language of Shakespeareâs plays structures the
                    relationships of characters in space. This study represents the beginning of a
                    digital method that aims to bridge text and performance in the study of
                    Shakespeare by reading the dramatic text for the linguistic codes that organize
                    the space of the stage.

                 This paper approaches Corinne, ou l'Italie through
                    an inter-disciplinary lens, drawing on literary, historical, and digital
                    methodologies. If Corinne is first and foremost a
                    Romantic novel that foregrounds the love plot between Corinne and Oswald, it is
                    as much a novel about the role of women in society, articulated through the
                    figure of the femme de gÃ©nie. The plot of the
                        femme de gÃ©nie finds its expression through
                    the trope of sociability, which I analyze through a social network analysis of
                    the characters in the narrative and a computational analysis of collocates. I
                    argue that through the constellation of sociability in the novel and the
                    national allegories that accompany it, StaÃ«l evokes an enduring partiality for
                    an Enlightenment ideal of sociability that remains deeply connected with female
                    emancipation. The lens of sociability thus allows for a re-articulation of the

        We present our use of the FSA-OWI Photographic Archive, a collection of over 170,000
          photographs taken by the US Government between 1935 and 1945, within Photogrammar as a case study of how to integrate methodological research into a
          digital, public project. Our work on the collection uses computational methods to extract
          new metadata surrounding individual photographs from the perspective of both the
          photographers and the original government archivists. Techniques for accomplishing this
          include mapping over an historical atlas, recreating historic cataloging systems, and
          digitally stitching together rolls of film. While many digital projects have focused on
          analysis at scale, our work on extracting new metadata actively demonstrates the power of
          digital techniques to assist in the close reading of even small sets of archival records.
          We conclude the article by describing how these contributions are presented in the Photogrammar site and describing the forms of collaboration needed
          to produce the final project.

                [en]
                
                It has recently become common to describe all empirical approaches to literature
                    as subfields of digital humanities. This essay argues that distant reading has a
                    largely distinct genealogy stretching back many decades before the advent of the
                    internet â a genealogy that is not for the most part centrally concerned with
                    computers. It would be better to understand this field as a conversation between
                    literary studies and social science, inititated by scholars like Raymond
                    Williams and Janice Radway, and moving slowly toward an explicitly experimental
                    method. Candor about the social-scientific dimension of distant reading is
                    needed now, in order to refocus a research agenda that can drift into diffuse
                    exploration of digital tools. Clarity on this topic might also reduce
                    miscommunication between distant readers and digital humanists.

                    memory, and emotion to update our narratological theory so that we might be
                    better equipped to read minds in printed fiction, digital fiction, and video
                    games. In doing so, Ciccoricco expands the remit of the burgeoning field of
                    cognitive literary studies, which despite its recent growth remains largely
                    focused on print fiction published before the 20th century. Refiguring Minds is an exemplary work of cognitive literary studies
                    which showcases both the fieldâs weaknesses and its strengths. While Ciccoricco
                    sometimes tends towards reductionism â a problem in any scientifically-inflected
                    field of literary study â he also enriches our understanding of the cognitive
                    processes in fictional characters and in ourselves as we engage with those
                    fictional minds.

                There are a number of fruitful digital humanities approaches to cinema and media
                    studies, but most of them only pursue traditional forms of scholarship by
                    extracting a single variable from the audiovisual text that is already legible
                    to scholars. As an alternative, cinema and media studies should pursue a
                    mostly-ignored âdigital surrealismâ that uses computer-based methods to
                    transform film texts in radical ways not previously possible. This article
                    describes one such method using the z-projection function of the scientific

                Exploratory studies have demonstrated the benefits of implementing Geographic
                    Information Systems (GIS) technology in literary and cultural-historical
                    research. These studies have done much to affirm the power and flexibility of
                    GIS technology as a resource for humanities scholarship. At the same time,
                    however, these studies share a common limitation in that they tend to rely on
                    the analysis of point-based cartographic representations. Such representations
                    are suitable for modelling quantitative geographical phenomena, but they are
                    inadequate for modelling qualitative human phenomena. This inadequacy
                    constitutes a significant problem for researchers who aspire to analyse the
                    geographical experiences and spatial relationships represented in works of
                    literature, including works that contain accounts of travel. The present article
                    proposes a solution to this problem by demonstrating how advanced spatial
                    analyses within GIS such as Cost-Surface Analysis (CSA) and Least-Cost-Path
                    Analysis (LCP) can be used to facilitate more nuanced interpretations of

                    the article explains how GIS, CSA and LCP can be combined to build coherent
                    spatial models of the journeys recorded in the works of three canonical
                    eighteenth-century British travellers, each of whom composed influential
                    accounts of their travels through the English Lake District: the poet Thomas
                    Gray (1716â1771), the naturalist Thomas Pennant (1726â1798) and the

                A project is a basic unit of digital humanities (DH) scholarship, which suggests
                    that DH as a discipline should pay more attention to project management, and
                    perhaps to develop the project management models, principles, and methods that
                    are more specific to the discipline. However, DH literature deals with this
                    issue merely by listing the basic principles, or offering specific
                        âtips and tricks,â which seriously simplifies management
                    of DH projects. DH projects involve building (or at least using) digital tools,
                    which brings the complex tensions between digital and humanistic aspects of
                    these projects. In order to address such a complexity, there is a need for a
                    model for managing DH projects that will learn from information studies and
                    methods in software development, while still being based on values of the
                    humanistic tradition and methods. This article combines a model of scholarly
                    information practices with some concepts of agile software development into a
                    hybrid model for managing DH projects.

                        so?â to consider whether humanists, more generally than just
                        âdigitalâ ones, might do thinking that is, at least to
                    some useful degree, âin the graphâ too. Drawing on the
                    experience of the Pliny project, and recent work done within that project to
                    explore how Pliny materials might connect with the semantic web, we explore ways
                    in which structured âgraph-likeâ thinking might be revealed

                    is common to digital and non-digital humanists alike. Out of this, we propose a
                    number of different ways that scholars might engage with the Semantic Web, and
                    provide examples â arising from the building of a prototype extension to Pliny â
                    of how these engagements could be dealt with. We also explore the challenge of
                    ambiguity and incompleteness in scholarship, explain how 2D space operates in
                    Pliny to cope, to some degree at least, with these issues, and consider the
                    boundaries between the expressiveness of 2D space and the formal graph model of
                    the Semantic Web. We end by proposing several possible avenues for future work

                    the nature of these âdisciplinesâ â most frequently conceived
                    of as either inter- or transdisciplines â before going on to examine in some
                    detail the participation of Modern Linguists in Digital Humanities and that of
                    Digital Humanists in Modern Languages. It argues that, while there is growing
                    evidence of work that crosses âdisciplinaryâ boundaries
                    between DH and ML in both directions, more work of this sort needs to be done to
                    optimise the potential of both disciplines. It also makes a particular case for
                    Digital Humanities to remain open to critical cultural studies approaches to
                    digital materials as pertaining to the discipline rather than focusing
                    exclusively on more instrumental definitions of Digital Humanities. This
                    argument is consistent with the concerns raised by other scholars with regard to
                    the need for heterogeneity of approach and in particular for increased cultural
                    criticism in Digital Humanities scholarship. Furthermore, we argue that this is
                    where Modern Linguists can make their most decisive contribution to Digital
                    Humanities research, offering what we term a âcritical DHMLâ approach. We

                In the Digital Humanities, there is a fast-growing body of research that uses
                    data visualization to explore the structures of language. While new techniques
                    are proliferating they still fall short of offering whole language
                    experimentation. We provide a mathematical technique that maps words and symbols
                    to ordered unique numerical values, showing that this mapping is one-to-one and
                    onto. We demonstrate this technique through linear, planar, and volumetric
                    visualizations of data sets as large as the Oxford English Dictionary and as
                    small as a single poem. The visualizations of this space have been designed to

                Digital archives change more quickly than traditional ones: they are adaptable
                    and transient. This has advantages and disadvantages; digital archives can
                    disappear from sight almost instantly but they can also be easily safeguarded
                    and restored. Borrowing the critical vocabulary of performance studies, digital
                    archives could thus be understood as ârepertoiresâ rather than traditional

                This paper presents the results of a study of 1,439 users of British History
                    Online (BHO). BHO is a digital library of key printed primary and secondary
                    sources for the history of Britain and Ireland, with a principal focus on the
                    period between 1300 and 1800. The collection currently contains 1,250 volumes,
                    and 120,000 web pages of material. During a website rebuild in 2014, the project
                    team asked its registered users about their preferences for searching and
                    browsing the content in the collection. Respondents were asked about their
                    current search and browsing behaviour, as well as their receptiveness to new
                    navigation options, including fuzzy searching, proximity searching, limiting
                    search to a subset of the collection, searching by publication metadata, and
                    searching entities within the texts such as person names, place names, or

                    of the siteâs academic and genealogical users, noting that the former tended to
                    respond in favour of options that gave them greater control over the search
                    process, whereas the latter generally opted for options to improve the efficacy

                 Early modern printed books pose particular challenges for automatic
                    transcription: uneven inking, irregular orthographies, radically multilingual
                    texts. As a result, modern efforts to transcribe these documents tend to produce
                    the textual gibberish commonly known as âdirty OCRâ (Optical Character
                    Recognition). This noisy output is most frequently seen as a barrier to access
                    for scholars interested in the computational analysis or digital display of
                    transcribed documents. This article, however, proposes that a closer analysis of
                    dirty OCR can reveal both historical and cultural factors at play in the
                    practice of automatic transcription. To make this argument, it focuses on tools
                    developed for the automatic transcription of the Primeros
                        Libros collection of sixteenth century Mexican printed books. By
                    bringing together the history of the collection with that of the OCR tool, it
                    illustrates how the colonial history of these documents is embedded in, and
                    transformed by, the statistical models used for automatic transcription. It
                    argues that automatic transcription, itself a mechanical and practical tool,
                    also has an interpretive effect on transcribed texts that can have practical
                    consequences for scholarly work.

                The art history domain is an interesting case for search engines tailored to the
                    digital humanities, because the domain involves different types of sources
                    (primary and secondary; text and images). One example of an art history search
                    engine is RemBench, which provides access to information in four different
                    databases related to the life and works of Rembrandt van Rijn. In the current
                    paper, RemBench serves as a case to (1) discover the requirements for a search
                    engine that is geared towards the art history domain and (2) make
                    recommendations for the design of user observation studies for evaluating the
                    usability of a search engine in the art history domain, and in digital
                    humanities at large.
                A user observation study with nine participants confirms that the combination of
                    different source types is crucial in the art history domain. With respect to the
                    user interface, both free-text search and facet filtering are actively used by
                    the observed participants but we observe strong individual preferences. Our key
                    recommendation for specialized search engines is the use of faceted search (free
                    text search combined with filtering) in combination with federated search
                    (combining multiple resources behind one interface). In addition, the user study
                    shows that the usability of domain-specific search engines can successfully be
                    evaluated using a thinking-aloud protocol with a small number of participants.

                This article demonstrates the use of data mining methodologies for the study and
                    research of social media in the digital humanities. Drawing from recent
                    convergences in writing, rhetoric, and DH research, this article investigates
                    how trends operate within complex networks. Through a study of trend data mined
                    from Twitter, this article suggests the possibility of identifying a
                        virality threshold for Twitter trends, and the possibility that
                    such a threshold has broader implications for attention ecology research in the
                    digital humanities. This article builds on the theories of Jacques Derrida,
                    Richard Lanham, and Sidney Dobrin to suggest new theories and methodologies for
                    understanding how attention operates within complex media ecologies at a
                    macroscopic level. While many various theories and methods have investigated
                    writing, rhetoric, and digital media at the microscopic level, this article
                    contends that a complimentary macroscopic approach is needed to further
                    investigate how attention functions for network culture.

                This article introduces the âSeshat: Global Historyâ
                    project, the methodology it is based upon and its potential as a tool for
                    historians and other humanists. Seshat is a comprehensive dataset covering human
                    cultural evolution since the Neolithic. The article describes in detail how the
                    Seshat methodology and platform can be used to tackle big questions that play
                    out over long time scales whilst allowing users to drill down to the detail and
                    place every single data point both in its historic and historiographical
                    context. Seshat thus offers a platform underpinned by a rigorous methodology to
                    actually do longue durÃ©e history and the article argues for the
                    need for humanists and social scientists to engage with data driven longue
                        durÃ©e history. The article argues that Seshat offers a much-needed
                    infrastructure in which different skill sets and disciplines can come together
                    to analyze the past using long timescales. In addition to highlighting the
                    theoretical and methodological underpinnings, Seshat's potential is demonstrated
                    using three case studies. Each of these case studies is centred around a set of
                    longstanding questions and historiographical debates and it is argued that the
                    introduction of a Seshat approach has the potential to radically alter our
                    understanding of these questions.

                This study examines the extent of the use of geographic code words in place of
                    racial terms in daily news reporting. This is a case study of the only daily
                    newspaper, the Toledo Blade, in the midwestern city
                    of Toledo, Ohio. A data set was constructed by searching a nine year collection
                    of Blade articles, available in full-text
                    searchable format in a ProQuest database, that included the most frequently used
                    directional terms and had specific street addresses (a total of 981 stories).
                    Besides bibliographic data, each story was coded for its location and the
                    general nature of the story. Street addresses were used to compile relevant
                    census tract information on the proportion of minorities in each area
                    referenced. These references were then plotted over a street map of Toledo
                    revealing geographic distributions that do not relate to actual cardinal
                    directions. Population data corresponding to each data point was then analyzed
                    to show that directional terminology correlates with the concentration of
                    minority population. Additionally, a comprehensive content analysis of all
                    21,667 Blade articles published in this period revealed racial differences in
                    reporting. Such quantified observations are reinforced by examination of
                    particular examples of racialized usage of geographic terms.

                 The field of humanities has now grown into a digital environment challenging
                    educators and scholars to create, manipulate, and curate data for research and
                    instruction. The humanities is faced with a digital medium that is changing the
                    way scholars conduct their exploration of research. This study encourages the
                    examination of imagery through qualitative coding, or annotation, to reveal
                    themes and visual stories to further unravel the layers of a visual object.
                    Images from the work of 1960s pop artists James Rosenquist and Roy Lichtenstein
                    were evaluated using ATLAS.ti to determine common themes, visual stories, and
                    aesthetic differences. Qualitative coding is usually associated with textual
                    data, but using a software analysis tool such as ATLAS.ti can centralize the
                    collection of data to efficiently code imagery, text, audio, and video. This
                    case study will be used to introduce researchers, faculty, and students to
                    qualitative analysis tools and the usefulness of coding to reveal themes in
                    imagery. Furthermore, librarians have an opportunity to facilitate the learning
                    of these tools in combination with the various proprietary and open access image
                    databases housed in the library.

                This introduction addresses two facets of the communication of Digital Humanities
                    (DH) that have framed this special edition of DHQ.
                    I begin by discussing a number of articles about DH that have relatively
                    recently appeared in mainstream newspapers. I then observe that a number of
                    these articles not only show an impoverished understanding of the fieldâs frame
                    of reference but also misrepresent various aspects of it, for example, its
                    interrelationship with the Humanities. Given that many academic publications on
                    the question âwhat is DH?â have appeared in recent years, yet DH is,
                    nonetheless, misrepresented in this way, I propose that the field must look
                    again at the communication of its activities âin the round.â Now that DH is
                    arguably moving from the margins to the mainstream I propose that the time has
                    come to address what we might call the âPublic Communication of DHâ so that
                    we can better communicate to the general public and academics working in other
                    disciplines what it is that we do. As the nature of DHâs relationship to the
                    Humanities is one that is frequently misrepresented in the mainstream media I
                    propose that this would be an important area for endeavours in the âPublic
                        Communication of DHâ to address and explore as early as possible. The
                    articles included in this special edition enrich and expand ongoing
                    conversations about the nature of this relationship. In doing so they make
                    available a wealth of case studies, arguments and insights that can, in due
                    course, be drawn on to further the âPublic Communication of DH.â

                In this article it is argued that one of the major transformative factors of the
                    humanities at the beginning of the 21st century is the shift from analogue to
                    digital source material, and that this shift will affect the humanities in a
                    variety of ways. But various kinds of digital material are not digital in the
                    same way, which a distinction between digitized, born-digital, and
                    reborn-digital may help us acknowledge, thereby helping us to understand how
                    each of these types of digital material affects different phases of scholarly
                    work in its own way. This is illustrated by a detailed comparison of the nature
                    of digitized collections and web archives.

                Digital humanities scholars have made a tradition of problematizing our
                    understanding of textuality through discussions concerning the design of
                    information systems for texts that, in many cases, still look like books. This
                    discussion is concerned with how creating opportunities for studying audio texts
                    further complicates our understanding of âthe rationale of a textualized
                        document,â defined by Jerome McGann as âthe dynamic structure of a document as it
                        is realized in determinate (artisanal) and determinable (reflective)
                        waysâ. This discussion frames a rationale of audio text within the
                    context of developing information infrastructures for accessing audio texts. I
                    introduce a tool called ARLO that we have been developing in the High
                    Performance Sound Technologies for Access and Scholarship (HiPSTAS) project
                        (http://www.hipstas.org) for
                    accessing and analyzing sound collections alongside new standards being proposed
                    for the development of audio visual (AV) metadata and content models. The
                    discussion concludes by considering what these interventions tell us about how a
                    rationale of audio textuality helps us rethink rationales of text in digital
                    environments.

                In this paper we introduce the syntagm âpragmatic modellingâ
                    as a productive way of contextualising research in Digital Humanities (DH). We
                    define âpragmatic modellingâ as a middle-out approach
                    (neither top down nor bottom up) that combines formal and experimental modelling
                    techniques with an effective use of language. Furthermore, in order to elucidate
                    a âpragmatic understandingâ of model building, we reflect on
                    texts (considered here as objects) and modelling (or strategy of analysis) in DH
                    research (and teaching). This paper does not identify a new practice or
                    approach; rather it offers an explanatory framework for existing practices. As
                    the paper explains, this framework goes beyond existing ones and allows us to
                    think about modelling in a more integral way. Drawing on this framework, we
                    reveal how DH modelling practices challenge epistemological and linguistic
                    restrictions, by, for example, problematising the adoption of terminology
                    belonging to the domain of computer sciences. Reflections on metaphorical
                    reasoning are used to exemplify how polarities and some rigidities DH research
                    could find itself embedded in are overcome in practice. We conclude by
                    advocating the importance of a diachronic and historical analysis of the role of
                    metaphors in DH to further explore the relation between theory and practice as
                    well as to develop models of modelling integral to DH research.

                For the past century, the sciences have made terrific strides in capturing the
                    public imagination. From dedicated television channels to online learning
                    materials to science-related entertainment and educational facilities for
                    families in practically every major city on the planet, the scale of public
                    relations has been impressive and continuous. However, the same cannot be said
                    for the Humanities. Although we certainly have cultural institutions for adults,
                    ranging from art galleries to opera houses, their primary emphasis has been on
                    providing opportunities for passively consuming cultural production, rather than
                    with the core interest of the Humanities, which is in enriching objects of study
                    by analyzing them through a variety of theoretical lenses. In this paper, I
                    argue, as others have been doing for some time, that the Humanities need to
                    learn in this respect from the sciences, in order to increase their public
                    stature. Further, the driving force behind this education is Digital Humanities.
                    Since public relations has been on the back burner for so long, this initiative
                    is both important and daunting; it is one of the ways in which the Digital
                    Humanities are strengthening the Humanities while at the same time encouraging
                    them in a task that seems difficult enough that everyone wishes it was not
                    necessary.

                    the following paper argues that this is not a genuinely new situation, since all

                        âcaptureâ new covers and bindings. During the 17th century, in the
                    lawless parts of the ocean, buccaneers realized that the right to depart was the
                    condition for the capacity to be bound. Therefore, let us dare to depart from
                    ancient bindings and create new boundaries.

                In this paper we present a statistical method for inferring historical social
                    networks from biographical documents as well as the scholarly aims for doing so.
                    Existing scholarship on historical social networks is scattered across an
                    unmanageable number of disparate books and articles. A researcher interested in
                    how persons were connected to one another in our field of study, early modern
                    Britain (c. 1500-1700), has no global, unified resource to which to turn.
                    Manually building such a network is infeasible, since it would need to represent
                    thousands of nodes and tens of millions of potential edges just to include the
                    relations among the most prominent persons of the period. Our Six Degrees of Francis Bacon project takes up recent
                    statistical techniques and digital tools to reconstruct and visualize the early
                    modern social network.
                We describe in this paper the natural language processing tools and statistical
                    graph learning techniques that we used to extract names and infer relations from
                    the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. We
                    then explain the steps taken to test inferred relations against the knowledge of
                    experts in order to improve the accuracy of the learning techniques. Our
                    argument here is twofold: first, that the results of this process, a global
                    visualization of Britainâs early modern social network, will be useful to
                    scholars and students of the period; second, that the pipeline we have developed
                    can, with local modifications, be reused by other scholars to generate networks
                    for other historical or contemporary societies from biographical documents.

                Historians have argued that nationalism spread from elite groups to larger

                    this paper, we use digital tools to search for expressions of nationalism in
                    Dutch newspaper discourse in the late nineteenth century by text mining in large
                    newspaper repositories. The absence of emotional nationalist rhetoric in Dutch
                    national newspapers suggests that nationalism in the late nineteenth century was
                    much more subtle than the literature based on elite discourse tells us.

                These days, we are constantly looking for an image of ourselves in the historical
                    past. âThe first ever information revolution,â begins a typical book jacket
                    blurb, âbegan with the advent of the printed book, enabling Renaissance scholars
                    to formulate new ways of organizing and disseminating knowledgeâ . A communications scholar offers a view of our place
                    in history that has echoes in countless other publications and presentations:
                    âAt present we are witnessing an information revolution whose significance
                    parallels and perhaps even surpasses that of the information revolution caused
                    by the printing press in the fifteenth centuryâ . Publishers, both academic and trade, have created a new genre
                    of book titles that confidently find the digital sizzle in the analog past:
                        The Renaissance Computer (on printed books),
                        The Victorian Internet (on the telegraph),
                        Social Media: The First 2,000 Years (on
                    letters, pamphlets, and graffiti). Scholars give talks with titles like âBooks as Social Mediaâ (Leah Price), âBlogging Now and Then (250 Years Ago)â (Robert
                    Darnton), and âWhatâs in a Visitorâs Book? Social Media and
                        Volcanic Tourism in the Nineteenth Centuryâ (John Brewer).
                Surrounded as we are by these analogies â by these claims in favor of specific
                    ways of construing the relationship between the past and the present, and by the
                    significance claims that go with them â it seems fair to ask what purposes they
                    serve. There is no doubt that we feel ourselves to be in the midst of a period
                    of dramatic change in our media and information environments. My interest in
                    this essay lies not in these environments themselves, but rather in our popular
                    uses of historical metaphor to explain them. Why, in particular, do we turn to
                    the rise of the printing press, out of all the options available, as our
                    standard analogy for the rise of the internet? What value does this metaphor
                    hold for us, what does it enable and what does it constrain, and what value does
                    metaphoric thinking in general hold for analysis in media studies? It is as
                    common for us today to use the printing press as a unit of measure in
                    estimations of information history as it is for us to discuss our current
                    circumstances in terms of an information revolution. But how
                    historically accurate are these kinds of description? What do they mean for the
                    ways in which we as futurists make use of history â and what do they mean for
                    the ways in which we as historians take the long view?

                    and epistemology, the time might be ripe for scholars to adopt such techniques
                    into their own research, particularly in the subfield of mobile communication
                    studies. One can now relatively easily participate in the building and
                    implementation of a variety of digital products, such as mobile apps, that can
                    then be used to study user experiences through interactions with rhetorical
                    forms, including a variety of types of informatics. Our experiences in several

                    including reflections on observations, survey responses, and other types of data

                This review finds that Jockers' Macroanalysis provides a clear and provocative
                    argument in favor of literary critics' use of data mining in
                    their efforts to understand literary history. The review
                    finds Jockers' case for a blended approach, one that
                    combines data mining with close-reading techniques,
                    compelling, and it finds, in addition, that his claim that
                    such an approach holds the potential to revolutionize
                    literary study to be a fair assessment of the possibities
                    offered by data mining tools and techniques.

                    at the University of Leipzig, the Perseus Digital Library at Tufts University,

                The Hellespont project (DAI, Tufts University) aims to structure the text of a
                    passage from the ancient Greek historian Thucydides (1.89-118), in order to
                    highlight events, persons and peoples that populate the world of the author and
                    connect the different digital sources available for their study. Event
                    annotation in the text in particular requires an in-depth linguistic analysis of
                    morphology, syntax and semantics. However, the available resources for Ancient
                    Greek do not provide adequate standards to support the encoding of semantic and
                    pragmatic phenomena in Ancient Greek texts. In this paper, we discuss the
                    motivation of the project and how we adapted the so called
                        tectogrammatical annotation of the Prague Dependency Treebank
                    to identify the events and describe their structure. The linguistic notion of
                        valency, which is central to tectogrammatical sentence
                    representation, proves very useful for this analysis of Ancient Greek.

                Over a decade ago, the Collaboratory for GIS and Mediterranean (CGMA) was created
                    with two stated goals: (1) to create an on-line GIS inventory of survey projects
                    in the greater Mediterranean and Europe and (2) to introduce advanced
                    undergraduates to GIS concepts through Mediterranean archaeology. Through a
                    specialized GIS course a small group of advanced undergraduate students learned
                    how to interpret map data, create effective maps, and build map hypothesis -
                    skills that are recognized as necessary for enhancing spatial thinking and thus
                    spatial literacy. In the last decade GIS technologically has changed
                    dramatically. The advent of Geospatial Semantic Web (Web 2.0) now makes it
                    possible to integrate spatial thinking concepts at all levels of the
                    undergraduate curriculum. This paper argues that spatial literacy must be more
                    intentionally integrated into the Classical Studies curriculum and illustrates
                    how we have begun to do that at DePauw University.

                Referring constitutes such an essential scholarly activity across disciplines
                    that it has been regarded by  as one of the
                    scholarly primitives. In Classics, in particular, the references to passages of
                    the ancient texts â the so-called canonical citations (or
                        references) â play a prominent role. The potential of these
                    citations, however, has not been fully exploited to date, despite the attention
                    that they have recently received in the field of Digital Humanities.
                In this paper I discuss two aspects of making such citations computable. Firstly,
                    I illustrate how they can be extracted from text by using Natural Language
                    Processing techniques, especially Named Entity Recognition. Secondly, I discuss
                    the creation of a three-level citation network to formalise the web of relations
                    between texts that canonical references implicitly constitute. As I outline in
                    the conclusive section of this paper, the possible uses of the extracted
                    citation network include the development of search applications and recommender
                    systems for bibliography; the enhancement of digital environments to read
                    primary sources with links to related secondary literature; and the application

                Coptic represents the last phase of the Egyptian language and is pivotal for a
                    wide range of disciplines, such as linguistics, biblical studies, the history of
                    Christianity, Egyptology, and ancient history. It was also essential for
                        âcracking the codeâ of the Egyptian hieroglyphs. Although digital
                    humanities has been hailed as distinctly interdisciplinary, enabling new forms
                    of knowledge by combining multiple forms of disciplinary investigation,
                    technical obtacles exist for creating a resource useful to both linguists and
                    historians, for example. The nature of the language (outside of the
                    Indo-European family) also requires its own approach. This paper will present
                    some of the challenges -- both digital and material -- in creating an online,
                    open source platform with a database and tools for digital research in Coptic.
                    It will also propose standards and methodologies to move forward through those
                    challenges. This paper should be of interest not only to scholars in Coptic but
                    also others working on what are traditionally considered more âmarginalâ
                    language groups in the pre-modern world, and researchers working with corpora
                    that have been removed from their original ancient or medieval repositories and

                Humanistic uses of digital technologies have opened up new ways to think about,
                    communicate, and discuss historical research. The common use of digital tools to
                    visually represent ancient cultures and sites, however, has also introduced new
                    issues. For example, critics have argued that digital visualisations, largely
                    synonymous with reconstruction in 3D models, often attempt to represent a
                    photorealistic-artificial vision of the past, and may often prove to be a way to
                    communicate history to a large(r) audience . Against
                    this backdrop, this article will discuss precisely how technology may help
                    immerse researchers into historically situated life, and radically advance
                    historical research. Adding to related criticisms of ocularcentric traditions of
                    knowledge production, we contribute to this stream of research by arguing that
                    contemporary visual representations of the past often concentrate on visual
                    representations and seemingly maintain antiquity as a sanitised
                    historio-cultural ideal 
                    . More specifically, this article seeks to
                    demonstrate the potential of digital humanities to move beyond mere
                    representations on screen and to mobilize other senses (specifically sound) as a
                    historically situated component for research. For this purpose, we focus on the
                    abstract principles and overall methodology for a recreation of the experience
                    of sounds in the Roman amphitheatre.

                Classifying and categorizing the activities that comprise âdigital
                        humanitiesâ has been a longstanding area of interest for many
                    practitioners in this field, fueled by ongoing attempts to define digital
                    humanities both within the academy and in the public sphere. The emergence of
                    directories that cross traditional disciplinary boundaries has also spurred
                    interest in categorization, with the practical goal of helping scholars
                    identify, for instance, projects that take a similar technical approach, even if
                    their subject matter is vastly different. This paper tracks the development of
                    TaDiRAH, the Taxonomy of Digital Research Activities in the Humanities developed
                    by representatives from DARIAH, the European cyberinfrastructure initiative, and
                    DiRT, a digital humanities tool directory. TaDiRAH was created specifically to
                    connect people with information on DiRT and in a DARIAH-DE bibliography, but
                    with the goal of adoption by other directory-like sites. To ensure that TaDiRAH
                    would be usable by other projects, the developers opened drafts for public
                    feedback, a process which fundamentally altered the structure of the taxonomy
                    and improved it in numerous ways. By actively seeking feedback from the digital
                    humanities community and reviewing data about how the source taxonomies are
                    actually used in order to inform term selection, the development of TaDiRAH
                    provides a model that may benefit other taxonomy efforts.

The Almanac Archive, a project in its early stages
                    of development, seeks to create a corpus of annotated British almanacs from
                    1750-1850. Cheap and useful, the almanac was one of the most commonly purchased
                    and frequently read print genres during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.
                    By focusing on readersâ annotations in almanacs about everything from social
                    engagements and weather to historical events and the breeding of livestock,
                        The Almanac Archive offers insights into
                    everyday life and ideologies of time. Creating a searchable, digital corpus of
                    high-resolution images from annotated almanacs will encourage new research
                    questions about the relationship between historical events, individualsâ
                    everyday lives, and the materiality of Romantic-era interfaces for tracking
                    time. By theorizing and sharing the ultimate goals and, indeed, challenges of

                My paper contains original âWord Processor Artâ compositions and an
                    explanation of the theoretical grounding for my work. I compose visual images
                    (comprised of words primarily taken from advertisements about the object they
                    construct) in a program not intended for that purpose (Microsoft Word). I break
                    from the expected form of the âWord Processor Documentâ to scrutinize how
                    machines, especially computer programs and the graphical user interface (GUI),
                    influence the consumer's utilization of computers. In particular, my project
                    questions how machines influence users' thinking and how the
                        âuser-friendlyâ inhibits creativity. The process disassembles the
                    notion of âuser-friendlyâ as a transparent influence and reveals how media
                    shapes the author's imagination and creations.

                The ever-present PC, in many ways, parallels the presence of the typewriter in
                    the 1950s, 60s and 70s, which led artists to experiment with the grid-like form
                    of mechanical type to create concrete and, eventually, dirty concrete poetry. My
                    work is inspired by these artists and the typewriter poetry they composed. My
                    work also references art collective JODI's compositions and how our contemporary
                    society resists the limitations of the GUI.

                My intent is to draw attention to the media of the composition. My work disobeys
                    the prompts of the GUI to emphasize the idea that pre-packaged programs elicit
                    conditioned responses and stifle genuinely creative uses of computing devices.
                    Nietzsche writes that âour writing
                        tools are also working on our thoughtsâ (quoted in ). My purpose in producing this work is not
                    a rejection of computing or the GUI, but to draw attention to an interfaceâs
                    existence and influence on its user. My work points to a creative space outside
                    of conditioned responses to the GUI.

                [en]
                
                The article begins by asking why comics scholars should create comics as
                    scholarship and traces possible answers through a variety of related fields:
                    English, Rhetoric and Composition, Art, and Games. It then investigates the
                    question of whether this article is itself a comic, by reviewing the history of
                    the conversation about defining comics as an imitation of the Bayeux Tapestry.
                    This tapestry section outlines the major camps, positions, and moves that comics
                    scholars have made. The two major threads are the essentialist camp (with
                    Kunzle, Eisner, McCloud, Harvey, Carrier, and Hayman and Pratt) and the
                    constructivist camp (Meskin and Beaty). The section ends with Bart Beatyâs
                    recent (2012) conceptualization of a comics world that does not need to define
                    individual artifacts as being or not being comics. The article ends with a
                    discussion of the importance of distinguishing definition from
                    conceptualization. Building on Beatyâs conceptualization and Gilles Deleuzeâs
                    theory of the concept and critique of representation, it offers applications to

               Introducing Derrida and Foucault for Beginners","Abstract
                [en]
            
            Academic writing has generally been understood as operating primarily within the
               linguistic modality, with writing remediating the âvoiceâ of an educator or
               lecturer. Comics, by contrast, are more explicitly multimodal and derive much of
               their meaning from visual, spatial and linguistic modalities. Because of their
               multimodality, educational comics challenge the conception of an authoritative
               authorâs âvoice,â as is typically found in traditional educational and academic
               writing.
            To examine how authorship and authority function in multimodal educational texts,
               this paper examines several books in the popular âFor Beginnersâ and
                  âIntroducingâ series of âgraphic guides,â which use images, text, and
               comics to summarise the work of major philosophers â in this case Derrida and
               Foucault. The books chosen for this study are all collaborative efforts between
               writers, illustrators, and designers. In each book, the collaborations function
               differently, engendering different divisions of authorial labor and forging different
               constructions of multimodal relationships between image, text, and design. 
            In order to more fully interrogate the ways that these educational comics combine
               multimodal modes of meaning, this paper itself takes the form of a comic, mimicking
               at times the books that it is examining. In this way, it serves as a self-reflexive
               critique of the idea that authorial voice is central to academic writing, and as an
               example of the challenges and opportunities presented by composing multimodal
               scholarship which eschews this conception of linguistic authorship.

                Our comic combines visual literacy, progymnasmata, and critical pedagogy to
                    showcase a classroom study that used comics production to teach visual literacy.
                    The comic first looks at comics criticism, visual rhetoric, and comics
                    scholarship to set a base to build a methodology build in critical pedagogy and
                    ancient rhetoric. Critical pedagogyâs tradition of inviting students to find
                    meaning in the origin of ideas fits in with having students design and study a
                    medium thatâs often overlooked during their college experience. Such an approach
                    echoes Freireâs ideas of using critical strategies as an effective model for
                    change. Progymnasmata, and Quintilianâs work in general, allows students to
                    approach the new medium of comics through reading and production through an
                    ancient rhetorical practice that relies on a step-by-step process. Looking at
                    Quintilian's pedagogy, we demonstrate a modern classroom study that uses
                    progymnasmata to make the strange familiar while introducing visuality. The
                    actual study is briefly discussed as well. This amalgamation of ancient
                    rhetoric, comics studies, and critical pedagogy is the basis of the research
                    behind this piecesâ goal of exploring comics as a multimodal means of
                    composition.

                [en]
            
            For nearly its entire textual life Ezekiel 16 has barely survived. Early Jewish
               communities were wary of including it in their canon of sacred texts because of the
               chapterâs explicit and disturbing imagery. Christian communities have likewise
               wrestled with the text by essentially barring it from communal worship (the text does
               not appear in any lectionary) as well as nearly bracketing it in scholarship (most,
               if not all, scholars see the text as a violent and gross misrepresentation of gender
               roles as well as one of the most exacerbating cases of divine violence. Kathryn
               Phisterer Darrâs work stands out as one of the few that allows the tension of the
               text to stand.). Despite all of these objections, however, the text remains in the
               canon. In this one chapter of the Book of Ezekiel, one finds themes of hope, love,
               despair, suffering, betrayal, grace, and abandonment â all foundational to the human
               experience. In addition to a colorful theological tapestry, one also finds a
               definitively historical text that is troubling to most contemporary readers.
               Theology, history, and contemporary reader combine to make the text and its message
               shocking at best and inaccessible at worst; this project proposes a solution by way
               of sequential art. Because the theological message of Ezekiel 16 is both wrapped up
               in the larger narratival context and presents itself through forceful and explicit
               imagery, exegeting the text via sequential art offers the reader a new medium for
               understanding the text. I propose a retelling of the story found in Ezekiel 16 that
               consciously creates space for the theological themes, historical realities, and
               contemporary cultural concerns all to be heard and to stand in tension with one
               another. Along with a sequential retelling of the story of Israel and YHWH, I will
               also annotate my work to provide historical, artistic and scholarly perspectives for
               the reader. I will first create the comic by traditional pencil and ink and then scan
               the images. The images can then appear in any form needed.

                This article describes a new method for inferring the gender

                    contrast to existing methods of gender prediction that treat
                    names as if they are timelessly associated with one gender,
                    this method uses a historical approach that takes into
                    account how naming practices change over time. It uses
                    historical data to measure the likelihood that a name was
                    associated with a particular gender based on the time or
                    place under study. This approach generates more accurate
                    results for sources that encompass changing periods of time,
                    providing digital humanities scholars with a tool to

                    gatekeeping in the American historical profession over the

                    shows the overall Amazon recommendation network for Digital Humanities and
                    allows us to detect clusters, aligned fields and bridging books. In a second

                This essay applies a digital humanities methodology to the study of digital media
                    by framing software history as a problem of big data and textual criticism.
                    While many scholars have already identified source code as an important site for
                    the cultural study of software, this essay proposes that close reading is not
                    suited to the scale and scope of modern application software. Applying text
                    analysis tools to large bodies of source code can help address these problems as
                    well as provide a basis for narrativizing its development and contextualization
                    amidst a complex network of economic, political, and other sociocultural
                    processes. Using source code produced over 15 years of development by the
                    Mozilla foundation, this essay argues that software interfaces act as an
                    extension of public relations narratives, often representing a developer's
                    idealized version of their software which may not necessarily correspond with
                    the state of the application's source code. Topic modeling Mozilla's source code
                    allows us to explore a more nuanced narrative of development that shows how
                    Mozilla has negotiated between the political ideals of open source software and
                    the corporate ideology of its parent companies.

                    studies?","Abstract
                [en]
                When game studies became an area for scholarly inquiry in the academy, feminist
                    game studies soon followed. The first generation of feminist theory in game
                    studies built on the work of Sherry Turkle, Brenda Laurel, and Janet Murray,
                    although some might argue that the legacy of challenging gender norms in game
                    studies goes back even earlier. Now feminist game scholars organize
                    international conferences, edit journals and scholarly collections, and shape
                    trends in the profession, much as their counterparts in the digital humanities
                    attempt to do, but critics in feminist game studies have been able to take
                    advantage of what is seen as a relatively long trajectory of feminist
                    theoretical inquiry and field development. Articulating a need for a feminist
                    corrective in the digital humanities has come at a much slower pace, perhaps
                    because the instrumentalism of a âtoolâ seems much less
                    blatantly anti-feminist than the instrumentalism of a gun. Furthermore, calls to
                    action from more radicalized forms of feminist approaches to science and
                    technology studies have been noticeably absent in the literature around digital
                    information retrieval in the humanities. This issue of DHQ indicates that a sea change may finally be taking place.

               for diversity in the digital humanities. It surveys digital humanities projects,
               outlining the need for alternate histories of the digital humanities told through
               intersectional lenses. Finally, the article proposes ways of looking forward towards
               the deeper intersectional analysis needed to expand intellectual diversity in the

            A part of the special issue of DHQ on feminisms and digital humanities, this paper
               takes as its starting place Greg Craneâs exhortation that there is a âneed to shift from lone editorials and monumental
                  editions to editors ... who coordinate contributions from many sources and oversee
                  living editions.â In response to Crane, the exploration of the âliving editionâ detailed here examines the
               process of creating a publicly editable edition and considers what that edition, the
               process by which it was built, and the platform in which it was produced means for
               editions that support and promote gender equity. Drawing on the scholarship about the
               culture of the Wikimedia suite of projects, and the gendered trolling experienced by
               members of our team in the production of the Social Edition of the Devonshire
               Manuscript in Wikibooks, and interviews with our advisory group, we argue that while
               the Wikimedia projects are often openly hostile online spaces, the Wikimedia suite of
               projects are so important to the contemporary circulation of knowledge, that the key
               is to encourage gender equity in social behavior, credit sharing, and knowledge
               organization in Wikimedia, rather than abandon it for a more controlled collaborative
               environment for edition production and dissemination.

                In 1986, Susan Harding published The Science Question in
                        Feminism in which she suggests that feminism had moved past
                    questioning ââWhat is to be done
                            about the situation of women in science?ââ â or first-wave
                    feminist initiatives â to include more women in the work of science. Aspects of
                    the âscience questionâ that
                    consider the politics underlying epistemologies of âpurportedly value-neutral claims and
                        practicesâ
                     resonate for the work (the research,
                    theory, and practices) being done to build information infrastructure in the
                    humanities today â the work that I am defining here as digital humanities work.
                    Reconsidering this work by using the lens of feminist inquiry to understand the
                    concerns common to information science and digital humanities is the perspective

            As discussion and debates on the digital humanities continue among scholars, so too

               about the role of the library and the librarian. Scholars appreciate the specialized
               expertise of librarians, especially in metadata and special collections, but they can
               take a more active stance in utilizing current library resources or vocalizing their
               needs for other resources. This expertise and these services can be leveraged to make
               the library an active and equal partner in research. Additionally, libraries should
               address internal issues, such as training and re-skilling librarians as necessary;
               better-coordinated outreach to academic departments is also needed.

                As the diversity of digital humanities practitioners grows, the need to construct
                    a framework allowing for equal acknowledgement to all involved has become more
                    evident. In this article, I argue that the perceived immateriality of
                    scholarship privileges conventional academic labor over similar pursuits, such
                    as data curation, resulting in them being glanced over and ignored in tenure
                    reviews and job evaluations. To counter this, I create a theoretical framework
                    that places materiality at the forefront. More specifically, I draw on and
                    expand Gilles Deleuze's notion of assemblages, as outlined by new materialist
                    philosopher Manuel DeLanda, to posit the idea of âdata assemblages,â which are the result of digital
                    humanities labor and consist of material parts contingent on their contextual
                    relations and always in flux. I use the Digital Public Library as a case study
                    and highlight how the reconceptualization of digital humanities labor moves
                    beyond the merely theoretical to allow us to better understand the
                    interdependency of individuals in the academic ecosystem and has broader
                    implications for the nature of materiality in the digital age.

            Textual bricolage, the unacknowledged re-use of chunks of existing texts within a new

               de-authorized texts. While it can result in unique literary juxtapositions, bricolage

               responses to textual bricolage reflects how a culture engages with textuality. Yet

            As humanities scholars increasingly recognize the value of public engagement, and as
               the proportion of tenure-track faculty positions available to new graduates continues
               to decline, many humanities programs are focusing renewed attention on equipping
               graduate students for careers as scholars both within and beyond academe. To support
               those efforts, the Scholarly Communication Institute has carried out a study
               investigating perceptions about career preparation provided by humanities graduate
               programs. The survey results help to create a more solid foundation on which to base
               curricular reform and new initiatives by moving the conversation about varied career
               paths from anecdote to data. The findings make it clear that there are a number of
               effective interventions that programs can undertake. Many of the skills that people
               working beyond the tenure track identify as crucial to their positions â things like
               project management, collaboration, and communication â are also highly beneficial to
               those working within the professoriate. Structuring courses and projects in a way
               that emphasizes the acquisition of these skills not only contributes to the success
               of students who pursue employment outside the tenure track, but also to the vibrant
               research, teaching, and service of those who pursue academic roles. With the
               availability of new data to work from and the recommendations above as possible
               guiding principles, graduate programs have a robust set of tools available that can
               help facilitate curricular assessment and new initiatives. As the importance of
               assessing the effectiveness of existing structures and considering potential benefits
               of reform continues to grow, humanities programs have a strong incentive to
               demonstrate the ways that their graduate programs contribute to the vitality of the
               university and the broader public sphere. Equipping graduate students with the skills
               and literacies needed for 21st century scholarly work â from technical fluency to an
               understanding of organizational structures â is critical to ensuring continued
               rigorous and creative research, scholarship, and teaching.

            With the growing volume of user-generated classification systems arising from media
               tagging-based platforms (such as Flickr and Tumblr) and the advent of new

               usability of crowdsourced, âfolksonomic,â or
               user-generated, 
                  âfreely chosen keywordsâ
                  
                for libraries, museums and other cultural heritage organizations becomes
               increasingly essential. The present study builds on prior work investigating the
               value and accuracy of folksonomies by: (1) demonstrating the benefit of
               user-generated âtagsâ - or unregulated keywords typically meant
               for personal organizational purposes - for facilitating item retrieval and (2)
               assessing the accuracy of descriptive metadata generated via a game-based
               crowdsourcing application. In this study, participants (N = 16) were first tasked
               with finding a set of five images using a search index containing either a
               combination of folksonomic and controlled vocabulary metadata or only controlled
               vocabulary metadata. Data analysis revealed that participants in the folksonomic and
               controlled vocabulary search condition were, on average, six times faster to search
               for each image (M = 25.08 secs) compared to participants searching with
               access only to controlled vocabulary metadata (M = 154.1 secs), and
               successfully retrieved significantly more items overall. Following this search task,
               all participants were asked to provide descriptive metadata for nine digital objects
               by playing three separate single-player tagging games. Analysis showed that 88% of
               participant-provided tags were judged to be accurate, and that both tagging patterns
               and accuracy levels did not significantly differ between groups of professional
               librarians and participants outside of the Library Science field. These findings
               illustrate the value of folksonomies for enhancing item
                  âfindability,â or the ease with which a patron can access
               materials, and the ability of librarians and general users alike to contribute valid,
               meaningful metadata. This could significantly impact the way libraries and other
               cultural heritage organizations conceptualize the tasks of searching and
               classification.

                    literature, an approach that reinvigorates the dated methods of New Criticism
                    for use in the digital humanities. Pressman identifies a genre of contemporary
                    electronic literature, âdigital
                        modernism,â and uncovers continuities linking it with early
                    twentieth-century modernism. In spite of an uneven style that oscillates between
                    belabored scholasticism and brilliant description, Digital
                        Modernism rigorously wrangles a wide array of data points â
                    historical, literary, and technological â to create an account of contemporary

                Of all narrative textual forms, the motion picture screenplay may be the most
                    perfectly pre-disposed for computational analysis. Screenplays contain
                    capitalized character names, indented dialogue, and other formatting conventions
                    that enable an algorithmic approach to analyzing and visualizing film
                    narratives. In this article, the authors introduce their new tool, ScripThreads,
                    which parses screenplays, outputs statistical values which can be analyzed, and
                    offers four different types of visualization, each with its own utility. The
                    visualizations represent character interactions across time as a single 3D or 2D
                    graph. The authors model the utility of the tool for the close analysis of a
                    single film (Lawrence Kasdanâs Grand Canyon
                    [1991]). They also model how the tool can be used for âdistant readingâ by identifying patterns of character
                    presence across a dataset of 674 screenplays.

                While research coordinator at the Burney Centre at McGill University in Montreal,
                    I pioneered new digital paleographical methods to support the editorial work on
                    Frances Burney and Samuel Richardson undertaken there. Prior to my
                    interventions, the primary method for reading faint, obscured, and obliterated
                    manuscript texts had been multi-spectral imaging, which is prohibitively
                    expensive, limiting its utility as a general research tool, although it is still
                    sometimes in use. There have not been many alternative digital paleographical
                    methodologies. The potential of image manipulation software, such as Adobe
                    Photoshop, has been noted by a few scholars, but not explored. Working in Adobe
                    Photoshop, I have developed a method of deciphering heavily deleted or
                    obliterated text through the use of layering techniques, altered color levels,
                    and the employment of certain kinds of filters. The method is more advanced than
                    simple image enlargement techniques used by most researchers. Importantly
                    though, it remains far less expensive than multi-spectral imaging. The technique
                    contributed to the recovery of nearly all of the obliterated text in the first
                    two volumes of The Court Journals and Letters of Frances
                        Burney, which were published by Oxford University Press in 2011, and
                    it was also used within in-progress volumes from The
                        Cambridge Edition of the Works of Samuel Richardson. This article
                    discusses the methodology and some of its key results from eighteenth-century

                    possible application for social simulation by comparing it
                    to conventional, print-based models of the history of book

                    of citation as an occasion to develop a web based prototype or model of this
                    decidedly paper bound text. The result of this experiment produced a digitized

                For digital humanists planning to build tools for cyberinfrastructure several
                    variables ought to be defined for each project. Pay close attention to the
                    balance of traditional methods and new ways of conducting research. When
                    gathering resources to do the job, seek contributions of different domain
                    experts. Also, careful consideration of a toolâs intended scope will help refine
                    the required resources needed to complete a project. This case study illustrates
                    how one project, the Social Networks and Archival Context Project (SNAC), has
                    defined these variables. The process of building a new tool also benefits from
                    an awareness of older infrastructure that has come before it. SNAC illustrates
                    this awareness in the way it has taken advantage of previously existing
                    infrastructure, both cyber and not, by extending its purpose and building new

                  âautomati[c]â or ârobotiz[ed]â fashion, as Flusser put it, so that, if
               anything, the digitas now âthinksâ us? The short answer to our question is as
               follows: we can think the digitas, but only if we consider it, firstly, as a kind of
               writing (âdigital orthographyâ) and, secondly, as a caricature of
               thinking, both impoverished and, dare we say it, funny (âdigital
                  caricatureâ).

                Though better known for the novels that eventually led to his being awarded the
                    Nobel Prize for Literature in 2003, there is a strong but less widely recognised

                    novelists first adopted, then deconstructed, and eventually rejected one of the

                The digital era has become inundated with the idea of anonymity as on the
                    Internet where users create avatars in forums and write without obvious material
                    constraint; however when considering documents such as graphic novels and print
                    fiction, the figure of the author remains a nostalgic figure which grants
                    validity to the document. In classic comic book collections such as Watchmen and
                    Batman: Year One by Alan Moore and Frank Miller, the original scripts by the
                    authors are included in special editions in both print and Kindle format. But
                    these âoriginalâ script pages are shrouded in forms of
                    anonymity as they illustrate signs of digitization, either through scanning or
                    during production and thus display various visual clues, such as errors, which
                    relay levels of realness. Furthermore online versions of these script pages,
                    found on fan website databases and authorsâ blogs, are complicated by the
                    anonymity the Internet and digital editions produce. Therefore a digital
                    forensics methodology is used to interrogate these script pages in both print
                    and digital format to create an ordering system for digitally manipulated text.
                    It also endeavours to illustrate the possibilities for a forming digital
                    forensics field by using various technical calculations and recreations of text
                    with original software and hardware.

            This paper is situated within debates surrounding modes of âcloseâ and
                  âdistant readingâ
                as they are played out in both the fields of world
               literature and digital literary studies. It proposes an alternative digital
               humanities approach to the study of world literature, advocating new methods of close
               comparative reading rather than the mode of âdistant readingâ endorsed by Franco
               Moretti and Alan Liu . Specifically, the research method
               proposed here is focused on a close reading of the novel The
                  Secret Scripture (2008) by Irish author Sebastian Barry, with comparative
               reference to Pat Barkerâs well-known war novel Regeneration (1997). Through the development and implementation of a
               digital humanities research method which facilitates new forms of digital literary
               analysis, we demonstrate that close reading and digital humanities can too be
                  âpracticing partnersâ in a way that serves to advance work in both the fields
               of world literature and digital literary studies.

                 Internet technologies are gradually reshaping the function of traditional
                    scholarly publications. There is a growing tendency in some disciplines to
                    publish a digital paper together with supplements such as images, videos,
                    3D-models and underlying data. More information requires a better usability in
                    terms of overview and finding information, which has led to new features in
                    journals and thus to modifying and extending this genre. These so-called
                    enhanced publications or rich internet publications have various physical forms:
                    PDF documents with embedded interactive models, HTML files enriched with
                    hyperlinks to contextual information and with facilities to highlight
                    information in the text, or aggregations of documents and other resources linked
                    together through metadata which make them findable for semantic search
                    engines.
                However, many of the originally print-based journals, particularly in the
                    humanities and social sciences, are still rather conservative in format and
                    offer hardly any opportunities for enhanced publishing, which leaves room for
                    some form of self-publishing, perhaps as addition to a regular journal article.
                    In this paper we introduce the Xposâre tools for authoring and displaying an
                    interactive multimedia scholarly publication, which may be created as a digital
                    companion to a regular journal paper and published, for example, on the author
                    or institutionâs website in order to share related research products and to
                    achieve greater visibility. We also report about practical experiences with this
                    software in a few research projects.
                The Xposâre software (see: http://xposre.nl/software/) comprises a Flash-based document reader
                    and a set of extensions (plug-ins) that extend the basic functionality of this
                    text browser. The extensions are used to display specific types of multimedia
                    that provide additional functionality, such as viewing images, videos and
                    interactive maps. The input text is XML based, which not only guarantees a
                    durable and flexible encoding of content, but also allows automatic rendering in
                    different formats according to the preferences of users and the limitations of
                    their hardware. In addition, the XML source can be easily transformed to an RDF
                    resource map to meet the requirements of the semantic web. The document reader
                    generates output in HTML, in two flavors, namely a slide based version that uses
                    JavaScript, and a plain HTML text (single page), which is most suitable for
                    printing and which can be used to create e-books. This plain HTML text can also
                    be displayed in a format similar to that of scientific journals through the
                    Xposâre HTML Reader, which has more features than the automatically generated
                    slides and which can be highly customized by the user.

            Well-designed digital tools facilitate the creation of new knowledge in the
               humanities. Good design is user-centered, focused, and needs-driven, all of which
               depend on a rich understanding of the target audience or end user. Unsworthâs

               framework for understanding how humanities scholars do their work. We propose
               applying this framework to the design of a spoken word archive, with the aim of
               designing a digital tool that is optimized for the documented practices of scholars.
               We propose that listening and annotation are key activities of humanities scholars
               performing literary criticism of audio recordings. Taking the SpokenWeb poetry
               project as an example, we discuss how designing a web-based tool with these key
               activities in mind could facilitate close and critical engagement with recordings of
               spoken poetry. We present a methodology for designing a web-based sound archive for
               literary criticism and we propose features and functionalities that facilitate this
               criticism.

                    of ending. The project we focus on is the Globalization and

                Among the many reactions against the digital revolution is a humanitarian
                    movement toward long form online reading in collective and social networks. This
                    movement â visible in online book clubs such as âInfinite
                        Summerâ and 1book140, websites such as longreads.com, and the trend
                    of blogs-to-books publication â is a reaction against superficial increasingly
                    brief headline-driven Internet news. Called to action by the threat of what
                    critic Jessica Helfand has diagnosed as digital cultureâs ânarrative depravation,â the deep reading revival has
                    reclaimed narrative and returned it to the populace, transforming reading into
                    an act of mass collaboration on an unprecedented scale. Despite studies
                    corroborating Nicholas Carrâs claim in The Shallows
                    (2011) that the distractions of the digital environment are anathema to
                    immersive linear deep reading, online culture has actually enhanced and
                    accelerated the appreciation of longer richer works through its support of
                        âradial readingâ as described by
                    Jerome McGann. This essay argues that while the intrinsically distracting
                    virtual geography of the Internet has threatened to diminish the role of
                    textured narrative in our intellectual and social lives, the Web has ironically
                    provided the media for the most salient movements in support of the deep reading
                    it threatens to obliterate.

            Systems of canonical references, whereby segments of written works are sequentially
               labeled with numbers or letters to facilitate cross-referencing, are widely used but
               seldom studied, undeservedly so. Canonical numbers are complex interpretive
               mechanisms with a great deal of potential for anyone editing and using electronic
               texts. In this essay I consider the rationale for and nature of canonical reference
               systems, to recommend principles to consider when deploying them in digital projects.
               After briefly reviewing the history of canonical references I note how they have been
               used so far, emphasizing the advances made by Canonical Text Services (CTS). I argue
               that the practical and theoretical problems that remain unaddressed require
               engagement with descriptions of how textual scholarship works and how notional
               literary works relate to the artefacts that carry them (using Functional Requirements
               for Bibliographic Records, FRBR). By correlating a theory of canonical reference
               numbers with those two models â editorial workflow and creative works â I offer key
               principles that should be addressed when planning, writing, and using digital

                This study analyzes popular songs composed by Japanese female
                    singer-songwriters. Popular songs are a good representation
                    of modern culture and society. Songs by female
                    singer-songwriters account for a large portion of the
                    current Japanese hit charts and particularly play an
                    important role in understanding the Japanese language and
                    communication style. In this study, we applied new methods
                    of computational stylistics to the lyrics of the songs. The
                    results clearly show differences in the characteristics of
                    10 female singer-songwriters, and we found that the
                        âvisualization of the lyricsâ is a
                    typical characteristic of current singer-songwriters. Our
                    findings provide an important case study for computational
                    stylistics and can also be useful for understanding Japanese
                    cultural trends.

            Scholars and practitioners of the digital humanities generally recognize the
               importance of solid project management and oversight. But coursework and publications
               related to DH project management tend to focus heavily on the difficulties of
               planning and launching a new project rather than the challenges of maintaining an
               established one. Meanwhile, online advice for would-be managers is couched in the
               language of âtips and tricksâ or âsteps for
                  beginnersâ. Together these phenomena downplay the professional skills
               needed to successfully manage a project while suggesting that project management is
               necessary only in the beginning stages of an endeavor. They may even give the
               impression that scholarship in the digital humanities is inherently ephemeral.
               Through a case study of project management practices at the William Blake Archive,
               which began publishing electronic scholarly editions in 1996, this essay details the
               challenges and rewards of managing an established digital humanities project.
               Managers of mature projects may be called upon to oversee expansions in scope and
               mission, research and recommend new features and tools, grow or shrink the number of
               project staff, seek out alternate sources of support when early grants run out,
               maintain continuity as collaborators join and leave the project, and develop new
               workflows and procedures to reflect these and other changes.

                    research. This article focuses on the Boerenpartij(Farmersâ Party), the first political party from the
                    far right that entered Dutch parliament after the Second World War (WWII). The
                        Boerenpartij is remembered as being
                    stigmatized by the traditional political parties as âwrongâ (â

                    on the Use of Digitized Historical Newspapers","Abstract
                [en]
                 Digital humanities research that requires the digitization of medium-scale,
                    project-specific texts confronts a significant methodological and practical
                    question: is labour-intensive cleaning of the Optical Character Recognition
                    (OCR) output necessary to produce robust results through text mining analysis?
                    This paper traces the steps taken in a collaborative research project that aimed
                    to analyze newspaper coverage of a high-profile murder trial, which occurred in
                    New York City in 1873. A corpus of approximately one-half million words was
                    produced by converting original print sources and image files into digital
                    texts, which produced a substantial rate of OCR-generated errors. We then
                    corrected the scans and added document-level genre metadata. This allowed us to
                    evaluate the impact of our quality upgrade procedures when we tested for
                    possible differences in word usage across two key phases in the trial's coverage
                    using log likelihood ratio . The same tests were run
                    on each dataset â the original OCR scans, a subset of OCR scans selected through
                    the addition of genre metadata, and the metadata-enhanced scans corrected to 98%
                    accuracy. Our results revealed that error correction is desirable but not
                    essential. However, metadata to distinguish between different genres of trial
                    coverage, obtained during the correction process, had a substantial impact. This
                    was true both when investigating all words and when testing for a subset of
                        âjudgment wordsâ we created to explore the murderâs emotive elements
                    and its moral implications. Deeper analysis of this case, and others like it,
                    will require more sophisticated text mining techniques to disambiguate word
                    sense and context, which may be more sensitive to OCR-induced errors.

                    undertaken with serious intent. It proceeds by isolating a key debate for
                    examination, describing two concepts that go a significant distance to solving
                    issues raised by that debate (but not far enough), and exploring the theoretical

                This review of Franco Moretti's Distant Reading
                    summarizes Morettiâs major arguments within the larger context of recent debates
                    in the digital humanities. Particular attention is given to Morettiâs uptake of
                    Immanuel Wallerstein, to his controversial critique of close reading, and to the
                    variety of digital-humanistic methods that comprise Morettiâs quantitative
                    formalism. Most valuable as an artifact of literary-critical history rather than
                    a how-to guide or theoretical treatise, this hodgepodge of essays is at its best
                    as an audacious and defensive academic memoir tracing Morettiâs transformation
                    into a digital humanist. As Moretti champions the broad explanatory power of
                    quantitative literary analysis, he overestimates the scientific objectivity of
                    his analyses while undervaluing the productively suggestive stories of doubt,
                    failure, and compromise that lend nuance and depth to his hypotheses. Combative,
                    absorbing, highly topical, and unevenly persuasive, Distant
                        Reading embodies both the optimism of early digital literary studies
                    and its perils.

                Randomly generated content poses problems for theories of digital art: such
                    content is resistant to structural theories, which can only provide templates,
                    and one cannot assume a shared text for close analysis. Instead of reaching
                    fixed endings, such works also tend to be of indefinite length or at least
                    suggest indefinite possible combinations. I argue that the impact of such works
                    can instead be found in how one attempts to work through their underlying
                    grammar, based on limits in the algorithms that generate the content â not those
                    limits themselves, but how their outlines come to be known. Repetitively
                    iterating through these works simultaneously upholds the chance nature of the
                    epiphenomenal occurrences while also illustrating the sameness of the underlying
                    algorithm over time, creating a future-oriented interpretive arc. I examine two
                    works that play off of this technique in different ways: Nick Montfortâs Taroko
                    Gorge, a poetry generator which uses random generation to distill the essence of
                    its objectâs possibility, and the action role-playing game Torchlight, which
                    attempts to elevate chance beyond a mere gameplay mechanic and toward an
                    ethic.

                    Humanities (DH) scholars, many of whom continue to be more interested in how we

                The Simulated Environment for Theatre (SET) offers an alternative to static,
                    two-dimensional visualizations of theatrical text by modeling the process of
                    moving from text to performance in the Western, text-based tradition of live
                    theatre production. Its interface links a three-dimensional âStage Viewâ
                    populated by character avatars to a âText Viewâ enhanced with text visualization
                    tools by means of a central âLine of Actionâ analogous to a timeline. All three
                    parts of the interface can be edited; edits in any individual section appear in
                    the others; and all three can be played back simultaneously. While emphasizing
                    that the traditional medium of theatrical performance is the actorâs body moving
                    in time and space, and providing a digital analogue for that medium, the system
                    also frees users from the limitations of the single, time-bound spectatorâs
                    perspective. Potential applications include theatre analysis, theatre pedagogy,
                    and preparation for theatrical production.

                    Funkouserâs New Directions in Digital Poetry set
                    new standards for the theory and analysis of digital texts. Eskelinenâs
                    groundbreaking book synthesizes his research of the last decade into a theory
                    for the new media textual condition with profound implications for the entire
                    field of poetics. Through Eskelinenâs transmedial reframing of the operative
                    categories of the field, it becomes clear how certain âuniversalsâ of
                    literary theory have been in fact strongly dependent on a limited corpus of
                    print-based situations. Funkhouserâs close readings of digital poetry are also
                    deeply informed by a hands-on poetics of digital writing and reading practices
                    on the web. Building on his historical account of computer poetry , his main concern here is to analyze the

                Curating is often seen as a mediation between artist, work, and audience, with the curator firmly at the center. The central role of the curator has been further emphasized with the rise of the curator as artist and the institutional and physical limitations of museum spaces. We argue that there are important alternative spaces of meaning to be developed between object and audience. Digital curating, in particular, allows for greater audience participation, both by expanding the potential audience and by allowing visitors to navigate through the virtual galleries under their own direction. We contend that by facilitating the site visitorsâ creation of their own visual arguments, a new level of audience participation in visual analysis â indeed, in a fundamental intellectual and intuitive aspect of curating â is made possible. We explore how digital resources can be modified to allow for that contextual sense of making a visual argument through arrangement. An installation at the University of Houston debuted a new tool for digital content management and allows us to make some preliminary observations about the process of visual analysis, its role in curatorial practice, and explore future directions for work.

            In their seminal report, Our Cultural Commonwealth
               (2006), the American Council of Learned Societies underscored the need for scholars
               engaged in digital humanities work to leverage their access to data both to expand
               their audience to the general public and to generate new research questions. âNow is the Future Now?â argues that the progress made in
               digital humanities toward these goals has depended and will depend not only on
               digital data, but also on their appropriate curation. The article defines digital
               humanities, data, so-called Big Data, and digital curation. Next it examines digital
               curation initiatives in the sciences and in the humanities that occurred before the
               release of Our Cultural Commonwealth. It then considers
               and evaluates the digital curation work undertaken in the sciences and in the
               humanities after the reportâs publication. In theory and in practice digital curation
               has benefited substantially from practices developed and tested first in the natural
               sciences and subsequently adapted for and extended in the humanities. Finally, the
               piece explores the future work necessary to facilitate symbiosis between digital
               curation and digital humanities. Collaboration and cooperation, transcending
               geographical, disciplinary, and institutional boundaries, data sharing, policies and
               planning, education and training, sustainability â all remain pressing issues in

                Within the digital humanities, there are many approaches to citation. Every
                    discipline handles citation and authorship differently, and within the digital
                    humanities there are wide divergences of practice in the ways that credit is
                    assigned and made visible. However, there is also broad agreement that citation
                    practices need scrutiny and perhaps rethinking. The issue arises with particular
                    force when we consider how to cite digital humanities projects and tools.
                    Standard citation practices do not provide good precedents for making visible
                    the contributions of project personnel in these highly collaborative efforts.
                    There has been significant informal discussion and debate in recent years
                    concerning appropriate ways to credit this work, but no consensus has been
                    reached. FairCite (http://faircite.wordpress.com) was founded to promote this discussion

                [en]
            
            In this article, the significance of the rhetorical and modern definitions of
               ekphrasis will be discussed through the lens of digital literature and art. It
               attempts to reinscribe the body in ekphrastic practice by adding touch to the
               abstracted visualism of the eye, and emphasize defining features of the ancient
               usage: orality, immediacy and tactility. What I call the digital ekphrasis with its
               emphasis on enargeia, its strong connections with the ancient definition, and on the
               bodily interaction with the work of art, conveys an aesthetic of tactility;
               digitalis=finger. By tracing and elucidating a historical trajectory that takes the
               concept of ekphrasis in the ancient culture as a starting point, the intention is not
               to reject the theories of the late 1900s, but through a reinterpretation of ekphrasis
               put forward an example of how digital perspectives on classic concepts could
               challenge or revise more or less taken-for-granted assumptions in the humanities. In
               this context âthe digitalâ is not only a phenomenon that could be tied to certain
               digital objects or used as a digital tool, but as an approach to history, with strong
               critical potential. The aim is to show that one of the most important features of our
               digital culture is that it offers new perspectives â not only on current technology â
               but also on literary, cultural and aesthetic historical practices.

                [en]
            
            In this article, Cordell demonstrates the transformative possibilities of large-scale
               digital archives for literary history and bibliography. Focusing on the
               recently-uncovered reprinting history of Nathaniel Hawthorneâs short story, âThe Celestial Railroadâ, in the nineteenth-century press, the
               article demonstrates the central, shaping influence of religious readers and editors
               on Hawthorneâs early career. Cordell shows how the best traditional bibliography of
               Hawthorneâs works could be dramatically altered after only a few weeksâ work in
               digital archives of newspapers, magazines, and books, and using relatively simple
               search tools. Such tools not only expanded the number of known witnesses of the text,
               but also uncovered numerous paratexts: introductions to the story, articles reviewing
               or referring to the story, sermons derived from the story, etc. This âsocial
                  textâ of âThe Celestial Railroad,â Cordell
               argues, lay buried amidst millions of pages that accumulated in the nineteenth
               century and required modern tools to be uncovered. The article also discusses how
               digital interpretive tools can help make better sense of such enlarged
               bibliographies. By comparing multiple printings of âThe Celestial
                  Railroadâ using the Juxta Collation tool from NINES, Cordell argues that
               textual fluidity can tell modern readers much about how texts were understood by
               their original publishers and readers. The many changes to and discussions of âThe Celestial Railroad,â for instance, indicate that the tale
               was popular for its perceived anti-denominational message, but nonetheless deployed
               as a weapon in denominational debates.

                Junot DÃ­azâs writing actively questions the boundaries between genre and
                        âliteraryâ fiction, aesthetics and politics, and English
                    and Spanish, using a framework of multiple linguistic, formal and cultural
                    registers to establish an authorial presence that defies critical
                    categorization. DÃ­az arrived explosively on the U.S. literary scene with his
                    second book, the novel The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar
                        Wao. The multi-generational story of a Dominican American family

                    in the United States earned many accolades, including the Pulitzer Prize for
                    Fiction and the National Book Critics Circle Award. I read DÃ­azâs transgressive
                    blending of genre and linguistic registers as a âreverse
                        colonizationâ that calls into question the demarcations of
                    American ethnicity as well as the racial politics of nerds. My argument uses
                    DÃ­az as both an object of study and a paradigm for the potential of a hybrid
                    digital humanities methodology. The complex cultural translation that DÃ­az asks
                    his readers to perform creates a middle ground where Caribbean history, language

                    core of the mainstream American imagination.

                    attention in September 2007. Posed out of curiosity, excitement, as well as
                    trepidation, the question includes anxiety about the re-invention of reading
                    embodied by new features and the intricacies of downloading policy. In this
                    essay, I focus on disappearance for the ways in which it indexes concerns about
                    the Kindleâs material impact on reading. Tracking these concerns, I turn to
                    three major moments in the Kindleâs âbiographyâ in order to
                    emphasize Amazonâs investment in mimicking the transcendence associated with
                    reading and the ways in which this investment is met, and at times exceeded, by
                    readerly desires to possess that transcendence. That the very name âKindleâ
                    should occasion parallels between e-reading and book burning, that Jeff Bezos
                    should claim unobtrusiveness as the deviceâs exemplary feature, and that

                    force of reading and on the other, reading as a relation of ownership and agency

Through a case study of Milton's Areopagitica, this essay explores how POD's zombie-like revitalization of earlier texts challenges us to broaden our understanding of the nature of digital textuality, especially as it pertains to the work of electronic editing.

        In 1995 in the midst of the first widespread wave of digitization, the Modern Language
          Association issued a Statement on the Significance of Primary Records in order to assert
          the importance of retaining books and other physical artifacts even after they have been
          microfilmed or scanned for general consumption. âA primary
            record,â the MLA told us then, âcan appropriately
            be defined as a physical object produced or used at the particular past time that one is
            concerned with in a given instanceâ (27). Today, the conceit of a âprimary recordâ can no longer be assumed to be
          coterminous with that of a âphysical object.â
          Electronic texts, files, feeds, and transmissions of all sorts are also now, indisputably,
          primary records. In the specific domain of the literary, a writer working today will not
          and cannot be studied in the future in the same way as writers of the past, because the
          basic material evidence of their authorial activity â manuscripts and drafts, working
          notes, correspondence, journals â is, like all textual production, increasingly migrating
          to the electronic realm. This essay therefore seeks to locate and triangulate the
          emergence of a .txtual condition â I am of course remediating Jerome McGannâs influential
          notion of a âtextual conditionâ â amid our contemporary constructions of the
            âliteraryâ, along with the changing nature of literary archives, and
          lastly activities in the digital humanities as that enterprise is now construed. In
          particular, I will use the example of the Maryland Institute for Technology in the
          Humanities (MITH) at the University of Maryland as a means of illustrating the kinds of
          resources and expertise a working digital humanities center can bring to the table when
          confronted with the range of materials that archives and manuscript repositories will
          increasingly be receiving.

                The Transborder Immigrant Tool is a provocative mobile phone app by the Electronic Disturbance Theater (EDT) that provides sustenance to border crossers by leading them to water and guiding them with poetry. Although the tool can be applied to any border, the chief border it has been tied to and tested on is the US-Mexico border. The EDT present the project as an artistic disruption of the tired national political theater staged at that border.  The piece refocuses attention on the basic human needs of those caught in the middle of the stale and stalemated divide.  For the EDT, every part of the piece participates in this disruption not merely the finished app or the poetry but the code as well.  In this paper, I ask, what would it mean for the code to poetic disruption?  One set of poetry for the project created by Amy Sara Carroll offers instructions for desert survival.  By presenting instructions as poems, she offers one entre into reading the source code of the app as poetry.  Using the methods of Critical Code Studies, I read the code of TBT in light of and as part of the poetic intervention of this complex performance.

                Digital humanities discussions of distant reading, machine reading or not-reading
                    have often turned on a depiction of the field of literary production in which
                    individual texts and authors recede in importance as units of analysis. At the
                    same time, the question of what is specific to the literary in discussions of
                    electronic textuality, or the digital literary, has been under-analyzed. This
                    article contributes to theorizing the digital literary by way of an analysis (or
                    close reading) of the role of machine reading in a postcolonial science fiction
                    novel by Amitav Ghosh, The Calcutta Chromosome. This novel participates in the
                    imagination of electronic textuality and digital forensics at a moment when the
                    imagined possibilities of the digital archive were of intense interest to both
                    cultural critics and literary writers. The figure of the writer of vernacular
                    literature in the novel, I argue, brings together the text's interest in both
                    electronic textuality and the subaltern archive, thus establishing the stakes of
                    the digital precisely on a revamped role for the literary in the context of
                    globalization. As such, Ghosh's novel provides a useful opportunity for
                    re-considering proposals for distant reading in relation to world literary
                    studies and postcolonial criticism.

        This essay is a meditation on the possibility of a feminist assessment of digital
          literary archives and the interdisciplinary tools needed to do such work. Using the Women
          Writers Project and The Orlando Project as exemplary instances of digital literary
          scholarship, I discuss possible sites of feminist intervention (content, technological
          politics, labor structures,etc) and the kinds of theoretical paradigms one might use in
          such work. I also argue that such assessments are essential to recognizing the ways in
          which feminist digital literary studies have impacted the field of digital humanities. 
         Drawing on recent work in technology studies and feminist theory, the essay
          problematizes simplistic celebratory claims and troubles the idea that simply saving
          womenâs work in digital form is enough. I conclude with a set of reflections on the impact
          of shifting ideas about the value of feminist work and theory in both public and scholarly
          contexts. This includes a proposal that more established scholars proactively highlight
          the feminist interventions that they make and that all digital literary scholars consider
          increasing access to not only the work of women, but to the technologies that are integral
          to that access as well.

                [en]
            
            Embedded in the rich textual record of international copyright law, we often
               encounter a quaint, and perhaps naÃ¯ve definition of the âliteraryâ
               around which the law has crystallized and which has the potential to influence the
               work of all digital humanists, whether they think of themselves as literary scholars
               or not. The first part of this article explores how a relatively narrow definition of
               the âliteraryâ as a category of âhighâ or
               belletristic cultural production has informed the contours of U.S. copyright law, in
               particular. Section 101, Title 17 of the United States Code expressly defines
                  âliterary worksâ as any âworks, other than audiovisual works, expressed in
                  words, numbers, or other verbal or numerical symbols or indicia, regardless of the
                  nature of the material objects, such as books, periodicals, manuscripts,
                  phonorecords, film, tapes, disks, or cards, in which they are embodiedâ
               . US courts have, however, often employed a narrower,
               more commonplace understanding of the âliteraryâ as an aesthetic
               category when sorting artifacts or content into other legally more significant
               categories such as idea, expression, criticism, parody, and satire. The second
               section of the article considers some of the potential implications and consequences
               of the current regulatory structure for the work of digital humanists. Judges
               engaging in a fair use analysis more often than not expect scholarship to come
               packaged in print monographs written in academic language aimed at an audience of
               disciplinary specialists. When they encounter scholarly artifacts that depart from
               those formal expectations and draw from pre-existing work, judges are less likely to
               find the use of pre-existing work is fair and therefore non-infringing. Finally, the
               article examines whether the literary as a category should be abandoned altogether,
               or whether digital humanists might productively redefine the literary as part of a
               strategy for re-imagining the institutional and legal regulations that govern
               academic work.

                What does the category of the literary give to digital humanities? Nothing and
                    everything. This essay considers the ""idiocy"" of the literary: its unaccountable
                    singularity, which guarantees that we continue to return to it as a source,
                    inspiration, and challenge. As a consequence, digital humanities is inspired and
                    irritated by the literary. 
                 My essay shows this in three ways. First, through a speculative exploration of
                    the relation between digital humanities and the category of ""the literary.""
                    Second, through a quick survey of the use of literature in digital humanities

                    as digital humanities concerns that necessarily engage with the literary. Once
                    again, the literary remains singular and not abstract, literal in a way that
                    challenges and provokes us towards new digital humanities work.

            Computational literary analytics that include frequency trends and collocation, topic
               modeling, and network analysis have relied on rapid and large-scale analysis of the
               word or strings of words. This essay shows that there are many other features of
               literary texts by which humanists make meaning other than the word, such as prosody
               and sound, and how computational methods allow us to do what has historically been a
               more difficult method of analysis â trying to understand how literary texts make
               meaning with these features. This paper will discuss a case study that uses theories
               of knowledge representation and research on phonetic and prosodic symbolism to
               develop analytics and visualizations that help readers discover aural and prosodic
               patterns in literary texts. To this end, this paper has two parts: (I) We describe
               the theories of knowledge representation and research into phonetic and prosodic
               symbolism that underpin the logics and ontologies of aurality incorporated in our
               project. This basic theory of aurality is reflected in our use of OpenMary, a
               text-to-speech application tool for extracting aural features; in the âflowâ we
               coordinated to pre-process texts in SEASRâs Meandre, a data flow environment; in the
               instance-based predictive modeling procedure that we developed for the project; and
               in ProseVis, the reader interface that we created to
               allow readers to discover aural features across literary texts. And (II), we discuss
               readings of several works by Gertrude Stein (the portraits âMatisseâ and âPicassoâ and the prose poem
                  Tender Buttons) that were facilitated by this

            Digital humanities and medieval studies share a long history, beginning with one of
               the first large-scale digital humanities projects, which was carried by Father
               Roberto Busa using IBMâs Literary Data Processing Center. Why then, do many scholars
               of historically-minded fields consider digital humanities to be a âhelping
               disciplineâ instead of a full-fledged area of study in itself? Beginning with the
               above question, this paper explores the ways in which scholars need not use the
               digital humanities to update historical disciplines or vice versa. By examining the
               pre- and post-print histories of the book, and interrogating the ways in which
               reading technologies and interfaces link the past and future of the book together,
               the past and present histories of reading coalesce and offer scholars novel ways of
               approaching many different disciplines that engage with the digital humanities.

            The Humanities now confront a new era in cultural representations â the digital age.
               As a consequence, our approach to culture may be modified because technology allows
               us to now visualize our thoughts and theories using digital and computing techniques.
               This research focuses on merging humanities research with computational sciences to
               explore the processes involved in culture dynamics. We present an interdisciplinary
               approach that combines literary studies, economics, and agent-based modeling (ABM)
               and give details of how literature maybe used as a data set that can be translated
               into a dynamic Java-based simulation of human interactions constructed around Game
               Theory. Our model of Cross-Cultural Cooperation is designed to study culture at
               various levels of granularity simultaneously in order to show how micro-behaviors
               might lead to macro outcomes such as cultural group formation. We present one

           This article outlines a critical framework for a theory of performative materiality and its potential application to interface design from a humanistic perspective. Discussions of the materiality of digital media have become richer and more complex in the last decade, calling the literal, physical, and networked qualities of digital artifacts and systems to attention. This article extends those discussions by reconnecting them to a longer history of investigations of materiality and the specificity of media in critical theory and aesthetics. In addition, it introduces the concept of performative materiality, the enacted and event-based character of digital activity supported by those literal, physical conditions, and introduces the theoretical concerns that attach to that rubric. Performative materiality is based on the conviction that a system should be understood by what it does, not only how it is structured. As digital humanities matures, it can benefit from a re-engagement with the mainstream principles of critical theory on which a model of performative materiality is based. The article takes these ideas into a more focused look at how we might move towards integrating this model and critical principles into a model of humanistic interface design.

           Artistic representations of African-descendant cultures in Latin America, the Hispanic Caribbean, and the Hispanic World have emerged as the outcome of multiple exchanges, inventions, and cultural coexistences. Such representations take part of a network where cultural, ethnic, social, artistic, literary, and racial information circulates, giving shape to centers with multiple connections at different scales. In accordance with this, the main aim of this article is to demonstrate how Cubaâs predominance for the representation of such cultural pattern is not only based on the significance of particular artistic figures, but also on the connectivity that the island as a cultural node has with respect to the âglobalâ  network of African and African-descendant representations. In order to achieve this aim, we carry out two main tasks: a) network analysis looking at related concepts such as centrality, connectivity, betweenness, modularity, etc., through a methodology that takes into account topic-map analysis and the use of Page Ranking Algorithm [the algorithm used by good part of search engines such as Google] as the basic formula to filter and organize information; b) local analysis of two nodes that take part of Cubaâs cluster in order to compare the results of the analysis of networks with a more socio-literary analysis that focuses on detailed reading of some of their messages (works, paratexts, prologues, interviews, etc): NicolÃ¡s GuillÃ©n and Alejo Carpentier. As matter of conclusions, we evaluate not only our findings with regards to Cuba but also the methodology as a contribution to the field of the Digital humanities and its practices of analysis.

            Despite DHâs long history, it is still perceived as a relatively emergent academic
               discipline which has several implications for its ongoing development and acceptance.
               In order to understand its role in supporting the fieldâs development and acceptance,
               SSHRC commissioned a survey of the larger Humanities and Social Scienceâs community
               to understand the issues related to DHâs development and acceptance and the types of
               activities that should be funded. The survey results suggest there is reason for
               optimism regarding the growing acceptance of digital methods, resources and tools and
               electronic dissemination as instructors, researchers, and students are using and
               publishing in digital outlets and creating and employing digital recourses, methods
               and tools andventuring into new research fields. This trend is likely to continue as
               students and younger scholars continue to embrace the digital in all aspects of their
               personal and professional lives. However, this optimism should be tempered to some
               extent as students and junior faculty are still less likely than associate professors
               to present and publish their digital-oriented research for a variety of reasons. The
               fieldâs more senior faculty can mentor their junior colleagues and students to this
               end and shape salary, tenure and promotion policies to recognize and reward these
               efforts. Finally, issues remain around the amount of funding required for the initial
               development and ongoing sustainability and relevance of digital resources and may
               become more critical over time. Granting agencies will need to evaluate their funding
               role in this regard.

                  This extended interview with Ray Siemens was carried out on June 21st at Digital Humanities 2011, Stanford University. 
It explores Siemens' early training and involvement in the field that is now known as digital humanities. He recalls that his first 
experience with computing was as a video gamer and programmer in high school. He had the opportunity to consolidate this early experience in the mid-1980s, when he   
attended the University of Waterloo as an undergraduate in the department of English where he undertook, inter alia, formal training in computing. He communicates strongly
the vibrancy of the field that was already apparent during his graduate years (up to c. 1991) and identifies some of the people in places such as the 
University of Alberta, University of Toronto, Oxford, and the University of British Columbia who had a formative influence on him. 
He gives a clear sense of some of the factors that attracted him to computing, for example, the alternatives to close reading that he was able to 
bring to bear on his literary research from an early stage. So too he reflects on computing developments whose applications were not immediately foreseeable, for example, 
when in 1986 he edited IBM's TCP/IP manual he could not have foreseen that by 1989 TCP/IP would be firmly established as the communication protocol of the internet. 
He closes by reflecting on the prescience of the advice that his father, also an academic, gave him regarding the use of computing in his research 
and on his early encounters with the conference scene.

Postmodern Culture and More: an Oral History

                [en]
                 John Unsworth recounts that he first became involved with computing in the Humanities c.
                    1989 as a new faculty member at North Carolina State University where he was
                    hired to teach post-World War II American literature. He and his colleagues
                    wanted to set up a new journal as only one other journal existed in that area.
                    They were introduced to the recently released LISTSERV software and the first
                    issue of the journal was circulated on email lists and bulletin boards. It was
                    called Postmodern Culture and twenty-two years later is still published by Johns
                    Hopkins University Press. It was the first peer-reviewed electronic journal in
                    the Humanities; nevertheless, not all senior colleagues were in favour of it
                    and, as a junior faculty member, his participation in it. He recounts that was
                    not able to avail of formal training in computing but he did have technical
                    knowledge of computing, mostly picked up while procrastinating on this PhD. By
                    the early 1990s he was reading Humanist and attending conferences that focused
                    on electronic journals where he encountered a range of academic and non-academic
                    projects. In 1993 he moved to the University of Virginia where he directed the
                    Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities (IATH). He reflects on the
                    wide range of people and projects that he worked with and that it was around
                    this time that he became involved with the community now known as digital
                    humanities. He reflects in detail on the first digital humanities conference he
                    attended in Paris in 1994 and concludes by discussing some of the changes that
                    the advent of the Web has heralded.

                [en]
                 Harold Short recounts that his interest in Computing and the Humanities goes
                    back to when he was an undergraduate in English and French at a university in
                    the former Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe). There, whilst undertaking summer work in the
                    library, he saw first-hand the potential of digital methods. After arriving in
                    London in 1972 he took an Open University degree in mathematics, computing and
                    systems. Among his early influences he identifies the reading he did on matters
                    related to cognitive science whilst undertaking a postgraduate certificated in
                    education. In the UK he worked at the BBC as programmer, systems analyst and
                    then systems manager. In 1988 he moved to King's College London to take up the
                    post of Assistant Director in Computing Services for Humanities and Information
                    Management. One of his first tasks was to work with the Humanities Faculty to
                    develop an undergraduate programme in humanities and computing. The first
                    digital humanities conference he attended was the first joint international
                    conference of ALLC and ACH, held at the University Toronto in 1989, which c. 450
                    people attended. He reflects on aspects of the institutional shape of the field
                    towards the end of the 1980s, including the key Centres that existed then, the
                    first meeting of the Association for Literary and Linguistic Computing (ALLC)
                    and those who were active in it such as Roy Wisbey, Susan Hockey and the late
                    Antonio Zampolli. He gives a detailed discussion of the development of what is
                    now the Department of Digital Humanities in King's College London, both in terms
                    of the administrative and institutional issues involved, as well as the
                    intellectual. He also reflects on some of the most successful collaborations
                    that the Department has been involved in, for example, the AHRC funded Henry III
                    Fine Rolls project, and the conditions and working practices that characterised
                    them. He closes by discussing his impressions about the movement of scholars
                    into and out of the discipline and of the institutional issues that have
                    had an impact on digital humanities centres.

                 This interview was carried out with Willard McCarty on Tuesday 27th March, 2012 in University College London. 
He recounts that his earliest encounter with computing was in the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory in Berkley where he worked with semi-automated 
scanning equipment for the Alvarez high-energy physics projects. After his dreams of becoming a physicist were thwarted he transferred to Reed College. 
There he did not have the opportunity to take formal training in computing; for the most part, Computer Science departments did not exist then. 
So, he learned to programme âon the jobâ with help from a talented physicist turned computer programmer named Bill Gates (no association with Microsoft). 
His first encounter with what we now call digital humanities was at the University of Toronto where he worked on the Records of Early English Drama project 
whilst undertaking a PhD on 17th century non-dramatic poetry. In 1984/5, as he was finishing his PhD, he accepted an academic support role at the Centre for 
Computing in the Humanities at Toronto, where he remained until 1996 when he accepted an academic post in King's College London. In Toronto he was keenly 
aware of the staff-faculty divide and the marginalised position of those who used computers in Humanities research. Nevertheless, the opportunities that 
the role brought to meet with a range of scholars interested in computing had a lasting influence on him. So too, with funding from the Social Sciences 
and Humanities Research Council of Canada he was able to undertake a research project on Ovid's Metamorphosis. He closes the interview by reflecting 
on his early involvement with the conference scene and people who have influenced him, from academics to his calligraphy teacher Lloyd Reynolds.

                 This extended interview with Geoffrey Rockwell was carried out via Skype on the
                    28th April 2012. He narrates that he had been aware of computing developments
                    when growing up in Italy but it was in college in the late 1970s that he took
                    formal training in computing. He bought his first computer, an Apple II clone,
                    after graduation when he was working as a teacher in the Middle East. Throughout
                    the interview he reflects on the various computers he has used and how the mouse
                    that he used with an early Macintosh instinctively appealed to him. By the
                    mid-1980s he was attending graduate school in the University of Toronto and was
                    accepted on to the Apple Research Partnership Programme, which enabled him to be
                    embedded in the central University of Toronto Computing Services; he
                    went on to hold a full time position there. Also taking a PhD in Philosophy, he
                    spent many lunch times talking with John Bradley. This resulted in the building
                    of text analysis tools and their application to Hume's Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion, as well as some of the
                    earliest, if not the earliest, conference paper on visualisation in the digital
                    humanities community. He reflects on the wide range of influences that shaped
                    and inspired his early work in the field, for example, the Research Computing
                    Group at the University of Toronto and their work in visual programming
                    environments. In 1994 he applied, and was hired at McMaster University to what he believes was the first job openly advertised as a humanities computing position in Canada. After exploring the opposition to computing that he encountered he
                    reflects that the image of the underdog has perhaps become a foundational myth
                    of digital humanities and questions whether it is still a useful one.

              The following contributions offer a comprehensive survey of the impeding turns in the scholarly agenda of digital studies. In so doing, they probe the future cultural scenarios looming beyond digital technologies and their related practices, concepts, and perspectives. Such a collective interrogation of our digital future investigates the full spectrum of the humanities. As a result, our notions of subjectivity, identity, consciousness, literacy, text, and medium emerge in these essays as significantly altered by the digital in unusual and unexpected ways. Papers scrutinize a variegated set of relationships between the human neurological network and the networked computer, real and virtual spaces, and subjectivity and procedurality. Scholars in this cluster re-envision such issues in the light of an all-encompassing ontological shift underway as a consequence of the increasingly pervasive presence of the digital in our relations with machines and their processes.

                While much valuable scholarship on the digital focuses on particular artifacts or historical processes or subcultures, this essay offers a preliminary treatment of the digital in general, proposing that the digital has its own ontology, a way of being, and that this ontology is manifest in the technologies and human relations that define and surround the digital. In particular, the digital places a central emphasis on abstraction, and digital artifacts and culture demonstrate this ontology of abstraction even while remaining concrete. The kinds of social structures grouped under the label Web 2.0 exemplify the materialized abstraction of the digital, and this essay points out the formal and technical features of the digital that carry the abstract nature of the binary code into the human relations and behaviors of Web 2.0.

            This critical essay was written for the Prairie Art Gallery catalogue presenting Kate
               Armstrong's and Michael Tippett's Grafik Dynamo! Its
               argument, implied in the catalogue version, can be stated explicitly in the present
               scholarly format, namely that narrative, associated with the development
               of the modern novel in print, is distinctly unsuited to literary arts produced in and
               for the electronic medium. Narrative in the Dynamo! is
               not entirely absent, but its dominance is put into question. The same holds for the
               place of argumentation in critical writing. The Dynamo!
               develops episodically, haunted by the comics, and by the popular and literary
               narratives it samples; the essay develops similarly, in blocks of partly
               autobiographical, partly analytical text. Propositions emerge not sequentially or
               through feats of interpretation, but at the moment when a block of text encounters a
               cited image from the Dynamo!
            
            Another collocation having implications for criticism, is the reading of
               Armstrong/Tippett's work in the context of a particular strain of contemporary
               fiction in print, which itself demonstrates that narrative was only ever a mode, one
               among many and not necessarily the dominant mode, in print literature itself.
               References are made to Pynchon's Gravity's Rainbow, to
               Pynchon's (and Armstrong/Tippett's) modernist antecedent, Henry Adams, to non-linear,
               non-sequential narratives by Robert Coover, Don DeLillo, and William Gaddis that are
               as open to innovation formally as they are expansive in subject matter. In this
               context, âGraphic Sublimeâ also introduces a major, as yet
               unpublished novel from the early 1970s by Phillip Wohlstetter, Valparaiso.

            Malware and criminal operations performed by botnets on the Internet not only pose a

               agency, which I call the webbot assemblage. Whereas news media coverage of its
               operations considers only their human aspects, mostly in relation to crime and
               cyberterrorism, Daniel Suarez's recent novel Daemon
               provides a suggestive glimpse into how, in a webbot assemblage, new forms of human
               and machinic agency are complexly intricated. The significance of this assemblage
               becomes further evident when it is considered in relation to how the Internet is
               increasingly perceived: no longer as a neutral medium but as an ecosystem defined by
               netwar, software arms races, and the possible evolution of âlowâ

               Lazzariniâs skulls, anamorphic artworks explore the
               tension between mathematical models of vision and an embodied experience of space.
               After reviewing the ways in which anamorphosis has been deployed as a philosophical
               tool for investigating digital media in terms of human phenomenology, specifically
               through the criticism of Espen Aarseth and Mark Hansen, this paper analyzes how
               contemporary videogames like Sonyâs Echochrome series,

               conceptually explore anamorphic techniques. While The
                  Ambassadors is famous for its anamorphically skewed skull, a classic
                  memento mori, we propose that the anamorphic effects of
               videogames can be more accurately described as a memento mortem mortis:
               not reminders of human mortality, but of a nonhuman the death of death. By
               foregrounding the impossibility of ever fully resolving the human experience of
               computational space, the memento mortem mortis in these âanamorphic
                  gamesâ gestures toward experiential domains altogether indifferent to human
               phenomenology to create allegories of the beyond.

               we call the user, the reader, the writer (or in institutional contexts, the
               researcher, the teacher, the studentâ¦) â is a subject of language. This subjectâs
               engagements with media and, by way of media, with other subjects, are determined by
               relations founded on language which French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan terms the

            I propose that modes of critical engagement and teaching in the contemporary digital
               field, particularly as the field shifts towards a more unified disciplinarity and a
               more secure institutional footing, can be described in relation to the graphs of

               narrowed â to the side of the hysteric and the analyst, whose collaborations are more

            The contemporary digital media ecology is one of convergence and hybridity. As
               virtual and technical interfaces intersect in increasingly complex formulations, the
               ability to identify organic vs. technical forms has become problematic. Virtual
               environments predominate within âeverydayâ cultural practice arguably limiting
                  ârealâ or unmediated human experience. The advent of social media artifacts
               and networks in particular â those that create fusions of personal experience and
               communal activity and that support and broadcast user-generated content as a
               foundation for media productions of real-life â have made organic bodies and personal
               experience difficult to discern. 
            Extending Mark B.N. Hansenâs model for identifying embodied experience within
               contemporary âmixed realityâ culture, I argue
               that embodied expression is more, not less, present in the contemporary media age.
               Organic expressions, those that emanate from primal, tactile, and motile forces and
               that operate prior to formal mediatization, are at the core of many social media
               artifacts circulated within the networks of contemporary culture and operating
               outside the aesthetics of traditional semiotic representation. Recovering the organic
               body and foregrounding its presence in such media asserts the functional
               non-aesthetic principles at work in many social media forms, particularly in those

              At the core of the work done within the digital humanities is a difficult interdisciplinary relationship between the at times divergent cognate fields of computer science and the humanities. This paper will explore some of the characteristics of the digital humanities and examine some of its hard interdisciplinarity relationships. It is the contention of the author that one of the central epistemological challenges within the field is to empower students to successfully manage the thorny interdisciplinary relationship intrinsic to technology and the humanities. Without understanding and managing this relationship, there is a danger that student projects lapse into exceedingly reductive pragmatism or overly theorised clumsiness. The author will suggest a model where this hard-interdisciplinary relationship may be taught and assessed through the critical use and analysis of digital objects within the framework of a Virtual Research Environments (VREs).

            The past decade has seen a remarkable proliferation of new works of constrained and
               appropriated writing that prominently incorporate, and in turn investigate, metadata
               schemes. I argue that these works ought to be of considerable interest not only to
               critics of contemporary avant-garde writing â but also to media theorists, librarians
               and textual scholars. By emphasizing classification protocols, conceptual writing
               makes an implicit case for the interrelationship of these fields. Each of the four
               main books under discussion here â Tan Linâs Seven Controlled
                  Vocabularies, Craig Dworkinâs Perverse

               Morrisâ Getting Inside Jack Kerouacâs Head â draws upon
               pre-existing textual archives. In doing so, these books suggest that processes of
               data storage, classification and transmission are key to how poetry is created,
               recognized and disseminated. Conceptual writingâs attention to information
               classification protocols offers not only a critique of contemporary models of
               authorship, but also of contemporary frameworks of personal agency and intellectual

                    Moving Beyond a ""Media"" Orientation of the Annotation of Digital Objects","Abstract
                [en]
                Digital technology often gives us the chance to re-conceive common scholarly practices with the humanities, and one of these is the practice of annotation.  Whereas many in the digital humanities look at annotation through the lens of social media, in this paper we consider annotationâs already established function in scholarship: to support the development of an interpretation of a body of material.  It begins by applying a âsoftware applicationâ perspective to annotation and it notes that personal annotation sits at the nexus between the publishing application of the material being annotated, and an interpretation development application that aims to support the readerâs thinking. Once this application orientation is taken up, it becomes evident that it is useful to re-conceptualise aspects of annotation beyond the annotation-of-media focus which the World Wide Web has encouraged in all of us. The paper does this by considering annotation in an application that is not media oriented in nature, Northwestern Universityâs WordHoard, and it explores some of the significance of annotation where the applicationâs data model â with its inherent semantic significance â is available to be annotated. There is a growing interest in thinking of the WWW as a delivery mechanism for software applications rather than merely for documents, and thus many of the issues that this paper raises could apply to the work of web-oriented developers too.

                    We then examine Transcribe Bentham's results during
                    its six-month testing period (8 September 2010 to 8 March 2011), which include a

            As museums increasingly place archival materials on display, a body of scholarship
               has emerged to provide practical advice for staff about exhibiting handwritten
               documents. However, there has as yet been little scholarship that problematizes the
               exhibition of manuscripts and the responses they elicit from their audiences. This
               essay, then, investigates the cultural perception of handwriting as an inherently
               unique and authentic embodiment of its writer, the assumption of which lies behind
               its display. Through a series of close readings of responses to the sight of the
               autograph, I examine the ways in which handwritingâs association with the human body
               has been historically shaped and interpreted; its current function as a locus for
               concerns about the loss or degradation of corporeal identity in an increasingly
               technologized world; and how multimedia museum exhibitions of handwritten documents â
               as digitally manipulable surrogates of original artifacts â expose, complicate, and
               break down the oppositions in this cultural discourse. Ultimately, I argue, digital
               interactives are part of a new exhibitionary paradigm, which not only offers new ways
               of considering an artifactâs essential meaning, but also refines and redefines our

                A Day in the Life of the Digital Humanities (Day of DH) is a community documentation project that brings together digital humanists from around the world to document what they do on one day, typically March 18. The goal of the project, which has been run three times since 2009, is to bring together participants to reflect on the question, âJust what do computing humanists really do?â To do this, participants document their day through photographs and commentary using one of the Day of DH blogs set up for them. The collection of these journals (with links, tags, and comments) is, after editing, made available online. This paper discusses the design of this social project, from the ethical issues raised to the final web of journals and shares some of the lessons we have learned. One of the major challenges of social media is getting participation. We made participating easy by personally inviting a seed group, choosing an accessible technology, maintaining a light but constant level of communication prior to the event, and asking only for a single day of commitment. In addition, we tried to make participation at least rewarding in formal academic terms by structuring the Day of DH as a collaborative publication. In terms of improvements, we have over the iterations changed the handling ethics clearances for images and connected to other social media like Twitter.

             Comics, comic books, and graphic novels are increasingly the target of seriously
               scholarly attention in the humanities. Moreover, comic books are exceptionally
               complex documents, with intricate relationships between pictorial and textual
               elements and a wide variety of content types within a single comic book publication.
               The complexity of these documents, their combination of textual and pictorial
               elements, and the collaborative nature of their production shares much in common with
               other complex documents studied by humanists â illuminated manuscripts, artistsâ
               books, illustrated poems like those of William Blake, letterpress productions like
               those of the Kelmscott Press, illustrated childrenâs books, and even Web pages and
               other born-digital media. Comic Book Markup Language, or CBML, is a TEI-based XML
               vocabulary for encoding and analyzing comic books, comics, graphic novels, and
               related documents. This article discusses the goals and motivations for developing

            This article identifies some of the popular and historical contradictions inherent to
               the very notion of close reading digital literature, and puts forth an updated
               conception of what the author argues continues to be a vital practice of literary

               historical conception of close reading and the sort of materially-conscious
               hermeneutics that digital textuality requires. The author applies the updated
               conception of close reading digital literature to Steve Tomasula's TOC
               , a self-described ânew media novel.â

                [en]
            Claims of the supposed disappearance of materiality in digital culture often entail a
               nostalgic reimagining of the supposedly embodied, personal or creative aspects of
               earlier writing technologies, including handwriting. Although handwriting was never a
               fully embodied writing technology, critics of transparent computer graphics often
               characterize it as such. This revisionist nostalgia for handwriting is evident not
               only in critical literature but also in contemporary graphical media such as video
               games.
            Two recent Nintendo DS games, Scribblenauts (2009) and
                  The World Ends with You (2007), represent two
               alternative modalities of such nostalgia for handwriting. Scribblenauts claims to fully restore the creative properties of
               handwriting, but inevitably fails to do so. By contrast, TWEWY claims to offer not handwriting itself but a digital- and
               DS-specific equivalent. Therefore, it opens up possibilities for critical reflection
               on the past meaning of handwriting and on the future of the values that handwriting
               has come to symbolize.

                [en]
                What is the status of digital literature in contemporary culture? Many scholars and practitioners assume that digital literature constitutes a contemporary avant-garde, which does its work of experimentation outside or in opposition to the mainstream. The notion of the avant-garde might seem thoroughly out of date in a consideration of the digital future. Important theorists (e.g. Huyssen, Drucker) have argued that the avant-garde is no longer viable even for traditional media and art practices. On the other hand, the avant-gardes of twentieth-century modernism made claims about the function of art that remain surprisingly influential today â within the art community and within popular culture. As Peter BÃ¼rger and others have discussed, an important division grew up in modernism on the question of whether art should strive for formal innovation or for sociopolitical change. Avant-gardes of the twentieth century took up positions along a spectrum from pure formalism (e.g. the Abstract Expressionists) to overt political action (e.g. the Situationists).  While the digital literature community is in general committed to formal innovation, some are critical of this commitment, in part on the political grounds that (technological) innovation has become a byword for the digital culture industry. Although the modernist problem is still apparent in some digital art and digital literature today, writers such as Jason Nelson seem to be moving beyond that dialectic.

            The original usage of avatar referred to the incarnation or human appearance
          of a deity, particularly Vishnu, in Hindu mythology. The term was adapted to cyberspace to
          name oneâs online persona. This usage has come to include every aspect of oneâs online
          representation, from the icon on a blog, or an email signature to the figure one plays in
          Second Life. Avatar, then, is a practical point of entry for theorizing the
          emergence of the new identity experience of electracy, that is supplementing and
          displacing selfhood, the identity formation of literacy. Playing oneâs avatar
          is to electracy what writing an essay is to literacy. The point addressed in this essay is
          that an avatar is not merely the appearance of oneâs representation, since through
          interactivity and even telepresence, I am t/here with my image. What is it to be/have an
          image? The answer begins with noting the literal meaning of the avatar in
          Sanskrit: âDescent.â Vishnu has descended (taken on embodiment)
          nine times, to correct a disordered world condition. This essay initiates a review of the
          cultural archive to see what is known already about our question (representations of
            âdescentâ). It is perhaps obvious, considering the prominence
          of Christianity in our heritage, that the West accumulated a huge amount of information
          about becoming body. Two examples are referenced in this introductory piece: Krishna and
          Orpheus.

                  how certain novel, media-constituted properties and methods of

               we shift our attention decidedly to practices, processes, procedures â towards
                  ways of writing and ways of reading rather than dwelling
               on either textual artifacts themselves (even time-based literary objects) or the
               concepts underpinning objects-as-artifact? What else can we do, given that we must
               now write on, for, and with the net which is itself no object but a seething mass of

               engagements are distinct, and that there is something at stake here for âthe

          Narrative","Abstract
                [en]
        Locative technologies hold out the promise to transform literary space in all of its
          dimensions, including its represented spaces, reading interfaces, and the very spaces
          within which literature is produced and consumed. Yet, despite the growing use of
          location-based technologies, authors and readers alike have been slow to take to
          site-specific narrative due to limitations inherent in both the current design of locative
          media systems and our received notions of what constitutes the narrative experience.
        This paper argues that new mobile reading platforms in general are altering conceptions
          of literary space in highly conflicted ways, by radically expanding the sites where
          narratives can be accessed and experienced even as they reinforce a residual notion of
          literary reading as a sedentary and decontextualized experience. Locative media likewise
          hold out the promise of increased mobility and contextual awareness, but confront several
          cultural and technological factors preventing such an enhanced emplacement of narrative,
          factors that current performance-oriented approaches cannot fully address. At the level of
          cognitive engagement, the conditioned expectation of being
            âtransportedâ to a remote fictional world interferes with readers'
          appreciation of the locative narrative's close ties to the real world, as well as the
          contextual effects it elicits by means of transportation through the actual world. At the
          technical level, the discontinuous algorithms of place that inform the architecture of
          most locative media systems hinder the perception of narrative patterning and flow across
          more extensive spaces.
        Locative media thus operationalize the spatial tension between conventionally sedentary
          modes of literary engagement and new modalities of mobility, a tension that is
          constitutive of our present mediality. The study concludes with a discussion of StoryTrek,
          a next-generation locative hypernarrative system designed to enable more complex, dynamic
          and fluid modes of embodied narrative spatiality. By encouraging the user to actively form
          complex narrative links between real and fictional spaces, StoryTrek enables utopian forms
          of spatial play that neutralize both the spatial limitations of current locative media
          design and the sedentary reading practices that continue to structure the experience of
          digital literature.

                    theory, and shows it to be an indicator of a larger discourse,
                    nodalism, that has its origins in 19th century neuroscience and
                    Associationist models of mind. This discourse provides a
                    relationship between structure and function that is used in
                    attempts to model thought in technological devices, as in the

                    instantiations of nodalism in turn provide the material basis
                    for the expansion of the discourse into other domains, such as
                    politics and economics. The paper concludes by considering the

            The research experiment described in this article, âReadies Online,â started as

               writers including Gertrude Stein, William Carlos Williams, Ezra Pound, F. W.
               Marinetti, Kay Boyle, Nancy Cunard, Eugene Jolas, and many others. Each of these
               contributors had sent works prepared for Bob Brown's machine, and he called the
               prepared texts readies. In the midst of building the collection of texts, the
               researcher realized that moving the texts through an electronic version of Brown's
               machine, or through the interface constructed on the website to simulate Brown's
               machine, changed how one read â even changed the essence of what one read. Speed,
               pace, direction, and visual cues took on new importance already apparent in reading
               printed texts, but not stressed. Punctuation now represented an illegible and
               non-representational, visual cue rather than a direct link to the phono-centric
               pauses and stops that are more commonly represented by punctuation. The futures of
               reading, and the use of new devices like e-readers, will have consequences for the

            Despite a general interest in exploring the possibilities of multimedia and web-based

               valid form of intellectual endeavor. Questions about labor, peer-review, and

               minds, bodies, machines, and institutional practices, and lays bare the fiction that
               scholars are disembodied intellectuals who labor only with the mind. We argue that
               while traditional ideas of what âcountsâ as scholarship continue
               to privilege content over form, intellectual labor over physical labor, and print
               over digital media, new mediaâs functional (and in some cases even biological)
               difference from old media contributes to a double erasure, for scholars working in

               semiotic web that drives Dos Passosâs narrative strategy toward a totalizing vision
               of the nation and, indeed, history. Bealâs paper deals with the progressive widening
               of network figuration in American modernism to think the very politics of national
               space, and in focusing on the machinic dynamics of Dos Passosâs form, the article
               establishes network discourses as the organizing principle of several
               pre-digitization modes of production, including Fordism and the modern
               corporation.

                [en]
            This essay argues that the urban collective novel serves as an important modernist
          precursor to network narratives. The collective novel is a literary form, particularly
          popular during the 1930s, that explores a wide context through a decentered narrative.
          Previous discussions of these novels have focused on them as exemplars of modernist form
          in proletarian literature. However, this essay shows another origin for the form in
          concerns about the metropolis and mass culture that complicates our understanding. Drawing
          on examples from novels by John Dos Passos, Daniel Fuchs, Albert Halper, Josephine Herbst,
          William S. Rollins, Jr., and Edwin Seaver it shows how these texts offered not only
          radically ambivalent assessments of networked existence but often a pessimistic view of
          the possibilities of political community, extending at times to specific critiques of
          communist politics. In its conclusion, the essay draws links between these novels and the
          cinematic network narratives that became popular in the first decade of the 21st century.

            This article argues that Sherwood Andersonâs Winesburg,

          technology, offers a modernist version of the story cycle that anticipates the delocalized
          and highly structured interconnections facilitated by the network. Unlike todayâs
          seamlessly embedded networks, however, the prototypical form depicted in Winesburg, Ohio functions as a kluge, 
                  âan ill-assorted collection of poorly-matching parts, forming a

          illustrates the networkâs propensity to foster usersâ inner alienation while enabling

               âThe Globe is All One: Wars I Have Seen as Proto-Network
                  Narrativeâ charts Gertrude Stein's characterization of the human mind as an
               data-processor by tracing the conceptual correspondences between her writings and
               early information theory, including the work of Norbert Weiner, Claude Shannon, and
               Vannevar Bush. The article argues that Stein first sees language as data that human
               beings are compelled to parse in even the most contextless and semantically
                  ânoisyâ frameworks, which shapes the purpose and form of Stein's notoriously
               difficult prose poem, âTender Buttonsâ; the ease with
               which meaning can be exchanged emphasizes the importance of the ways in which a given
               meaning is selected from a set of possible meanings rather than interpreted or
               revealed. While this may simply reiterate the mode of âTender
                  Buttonsâ in different terms, the paper's crucial intervention is in its
               positioning of the chance selection of significance as the mode of signification that
               animates her wartime memoir âWars I Have Seenâ. Like words
               in the poem, political identity in occupied France is unstable and waits to be parsed
               in the act of encounters with others and with history. In her narrative's
               foregrounding of and experimental play with the conventions of memoir, Stein
               discovers the shifting nature of her main character (herself) in a series of
               ruminations and chance meetings; an early version of the network narrative emerges in
               the nodal structure of the story that undermines chronological and nationalist frames
               of signification.

            There is currently an infrastructure turn with very real implications for the humanities
          and digital humanities. It comes not only with presumed technology or infrastructure, but
          also with certain assumptions, discursive patterns, and models. This paper analyzes these
          critically and advocates a humanities-based notion of cyberinfrastructure, not necessarily
          built on a science-and-engineering paradigm or exclusively grounded in existing humanities
          infrastructure. It is argued that we need to maintain a critical stance while
          simultaneously engaging in the exploration of research issues and technologies. There is
          often a gap between the material details of infrastructure and underlying, foundational
          ideas, and it is suggested that a model based on conceptual cyberinfrastructure and design
          parameters can be one way of connecting the ideational level with actual implementation.

            As digital humanists have adopted visualization tools in their work, they have borrowed
          methods developed for the graphical display of information in the natural and social
          sciences. These tools carry with them assumptions of knowledge as observer-independent and
          certain, rather than observer co-dependent and interpretative. This paper argues that we
          need a humanities approach to the graphical expression of interpretation. To begin, the
          concept of data as a given has to be rethought through a humanistic lens and
          characterized as capta, taken and constructed. Next, the forms for graphical
          expression of capta need to be more nuanced to show ambiguity and complexity. Finally, the
          use of a humanistic approach, rooted in a co-dependent relation between observer and
          experience, needs to be expressed according to graphics built from
          interpretative models. In summary: all data have to be understood as capta and the
          conventions created to express observer-independent models of knowledge need to be
          radically reworked to express humanistic interpretation.

          Interactive Fiction","Abstract
                [en]
        Existing scholarship on interactive fiction (IF, also known as the text adventure) tends
          to treat it as a video game genre and/or as a category of electronic literature. In this
          essay I argue that IF can be understood as participating in traditions of visual prose and
          ekphrastic textuality, insofar as IF consists of room and object descriptions which direct
          the player to visualize the things they describe. Unlike traditional ekphrastic
          literature, however, IF also asks the player to take practical actions in response to the
          images he or she visualizes. During the commercial era of IF, ekphrasis was the most
          effective means available of providing players with immersive visual experiences. However,
          graphical video games have now surpassed IF in this area. Therefore, in order to justify
          the continued existence of IF, contemporary IF authors have been forced to conceive of the
          visuality of IF otherwise than in terms of the logic of transparency. One strategy for
          doing this, exemplified by Nick Montfort's game, Ad Verbum,
          is to abandon visuality almost entirely and emphasize IF's linguistic and textual
          qualities. An alternative strategy, exemplified by Emily Short's game City of Secrets, is to assert that IF is visual in a non-transparent way,
          because IF offers visual experiences which are user-generated rather than pre-rendered.

               in the autographs of the Italian contemporary poet Valerio Magrelli. These encoding

               solutions for representing the complex temporal structures normally present in
               manuscripts, and in fluid textual traditions in general. Our conclusion is that there
               is a potential conflict between the linear and hierchical nature of current formal
               language systems such as XML, and the intrinsic dynamic nature of the writing
               process. In such cases we may have to rethink present models of document modeling,

                [en]
            Within the field of archival science, recent attention has been paid to identifying
               scholastic practices that will ensure the development of innovative research as well
               as the preparedness of future archival educators. Information science, long the
               academic frame of archival programs in the U.S. and elsewhere, currently allows for
               considerable co-expansion with digital humanities innovations when we consider the
               possibility of digital libraries, digital archives, and web-based collections
               integrating a humanist approach to display and users' interactivity with cultural
               objects. This paper reviews a workshop dedicated to charting the relationship between
               digital humanities and archival scholarship, as well as the opportunities to refine
               curricular and theoretical development in these two disciplines. The concepts
               expressed here would facilitate the efforts of practitioners to critically examine
               issues of pedagogy, practical training, and disciplinary alignment under a goal of
               sustaining the extraordinary expansion of applied humanist theory exemplified in
               research ventures we have seen thus far.

Both works make remarkable contributions for the emerging field of digital literary studies and for the theory of digital media. While Hayles analyses the interaction between humans and computing machines as embodied in electronic works, Kirschenbaum conceptualizes digitality at the level of inscription and establishes a social text rationale for electronic objects.

                [en]
            e-Science and high performance computing (HPC) have the potential to allow large datasets to be searched and analysed quickly, efficiently, and in complex and novel ways. Little application has been made of the processing power of grid technologies to humanities data, due to lack of available large-scale datasets, and little understanding of or access to e-Science technologies. The Researching e-Science Analysis of Census Holdings (ReACH) scoping study, an AHRC-funded e-science workshop series, was established to investigate the potential application of grid computing to a large dataset of interest to historians, humanists, digital consumers, and the general public: historical census records. Consisting of three one-day workshops held at UCL in Summer 2006, the workshop series brought together expertise across different domains to ascertain how useful, possible, or feasible it would be to analyse datasets from Ancestry and The National Archives using the HPC facilities available at UCL. This article details the academic, technical, managerial, and legal issues highlighted in the project when attempting to apply HPC to historical data sets. Additionally, generic issues facing humanities researchers attempting to utilise HPC technologies in their research are presented.

                [en]
            Medievalists typically resort to parchment for primary research and when editing
               their sources. Not always accurately catalogued, manuscripts copied onto animal skins
               may have started life in the same workshop but over the centuries have become
               dispersed, coming to rest in libraries all over the world; bringing these together
               entails travel, microfilm purchases and reassembly and collation of the data within
               reach of a microfilm reader. These unwieldy machines afford only moderate scope for
               exploring single manuscripts at close quarters. High-resolution digitisation yields
               not just better surrogates in full colour; it allows for the development of
               additional research tools using image compression and manipulation, and new modes of
               representation, e.g. juxtaposed display of several related witnesses. This paper
               outlines research questions underpinning the development of an electronic tool for
               viewing, transcribing and manipulating manuscripts; it moves on to show how the
               viewer can be adapted for access from remote sites, to compare and annotation one or
               more witnesses (interactively and in real time), and for use as an integral part of
               an online edition. Finally, it explores how it can be deployed for use on projects
               taking knowledge outside the academy: in museums, galleries and other public
               spaces.

                [en]
            Software Engineering, as a sub-discipline of the broader field of computer science, is concerned with the production, use, and maintenance of large, complex software systems. On first inspection, the set of managerial and technical activities involved in software engineering appears to be somewhat orthogonal to core research activity in the humanities, being concerned more with the production of research-enabling software systems than the research itself. However, as the scale of software used in digital humanities has increased, it is becoming clear that there are ways in which software engineering can inform, inspire, and aid in the management of the larger-scale software systems now being constructed in these disciplines. In particular, the development of service technology to aid in the production of flexible software systems for business now offers opportunities, not only for collaborative data sharing, but also the modelling, capture, provenancing, and replay of the research (and possibly creative) process itself.
            This paper examines, from the perspective of a software engineer relatively new to the digital humanities, how the recent developments in service-oriented architectures could be used to enable new approaches to digital enquiry in the arts and humanities. The first part of the paper presents a brief history of software engineering, with particular reference to the aspects that have led to service-oriented architectures. In the second part, the paper offers some thoughts on how certain aspects of service-oriented architectures could be used to enable new kinds of computer-based research and practice in the arts and humanities. It also introduces important national initiatives in this area, such as the JISC e-Framework programme for Higher Education.

               (and, indeed, what isn't today), Sporton argues that beyond the effect 
               of explaining this is something to do with technology, there is an 
               emergent âe-cultureâ that reunites the arts and sciences after two 
               hundred years of separate development within the academy.  An 
               âe-Cultureâ emerges that reflects the values, opportunities and

                [en]
            This paper arises out of a brief period in the early- to mid-2000s when the British
               funding and research climate facilitated a relationship between the technical,
               operational language of e-Science and the creative and performing arts. It concerns
               the ways in which live creative practices produce media traces that are fractured
               across screens and networks to produce new spatial relations between live events and
               their records. The split and contradictory subjectivities produced in these highly
               mediatized environments bring to the fore creative tensions between the live event
               and the recorded document. That is, the discourses, technologies and practices (if we
               may separate these) of e-Science not only produce new, spatial connections between
               events and their archives, they enact the âlivenessâ of archives as they are
               accessed and recombined to produce new art forms. Locating Grid Technologies:
               Performativity, Place, Space, a research workshop series funded by the A&H
               e-Science Initiative in its 2006 round, aimed to investigate how e-Science
               technologies might inform new understandings of space and time for distributed,
               creative research practices. Arts and technology researchers from the UK, US and
               Japan met to generate, analyze and re-use audio-visual documents of distributed
               practice-led research. Specifically, the project sought to combine and repurpose
               e-Science tools in order to investigate the spatial relationships produced between
               time-based, live events and their immediately mediatized traces. This paper
               investigates those performative fragmentations of place and space. It suggests that
               the potentialities and pitfalls of e-Science tools and technologies present fertile
               material for the arts researcher, particularly within the area of practice-based
               research: from the politics of surveillance to the aesthetics of video compression,
               from the ethics of multidisciplinary collaboration to the theoretical implications of
               mixing video time and space with the time and space of the performance event.

                [en]
            In this article, we evaluate approaches using logic reasoning applied to an ontology
               for literary characters. The inference tool Racer and the programming language Prolog
               were tested and compared to see if they can serve as a computer assisted approach in
               this scenario.
            Both offer options to draw inferences, but the usage requests a good comprehension of
               logics. Intuitive and individual queries are also difficult to produce with solely
               logic constructs. Furthermore, information in humanities is often vague, ambiguous,
               or even contradictory. Solving such problems by logic reasoning which is simply based
               on true or false conclusions will become challenging and might exceed the limits of
               logic reasoning.
            At the moment, to the authorâs knowledge, only few such approaches, especially in
               literature studies, have been published. Existing approaches show promising results
               in modelling information in humanities. Therefore, further research should be
               directed to make ontologies and further approaches like logic reasoning even more
               popular and applicable in the humanities and literature studies.

                [en]
            Broadly conceived, this article re-imagines the role of conjecture in textual
               scholarship at a time when computers are increasingly pressed into service as tools
               of reconstruction and forecasting. Examples of conjecture include the recovery of
               lost readings in classical texts, and the computational modeling of the evolution of
               a literary work or the descent of a natural language. Conjectural criticism is thus
               concerned with issues of transmission, transformation, and prediction. It has ancient
               parallels in divination and modern parallels in the comparative methods of historical
               linguistics and evolutionary biology.
            The article develops a computational model of textuality, one that better supports
               conjectural reasoning, as a counterweight to the pictorial model of textuality that
               now predominates in the field of textual scholarship. âComputationâ is here
               broadly understood to mean the manipulation of discrete units of information, which,
               in the case of language, entails the grammatical processing of strings rather than
               the mathematical calculation of numbers to create puns, anagrams, word ladders, and
               other word games. The article thus proposes that a textual scholar endeavoring to
               recover a prior version of a text, a diviner attempting to decipher an oracle by
               signs, and a poet exploiting the combinatorial play of language collectively draw on
               the same library of semiotic operations, which are amenable to algorithmic
               expression.
            The intended audience for the article includes textual scholars, specialists in the
               digital humanities and new media, and others interested in the technology of the
               written word and the emerging field of biohumanities.

                [en]
            The digital humanities are at a critical moment in the transition from a specialty area to a full-fledged community with a common set of methods, sources of evidence, and infrastructure â all of which are necessary for achieving academic recognition.  As budgets are slashed and marginal programs are eliminated in the current economic crisis, only the most articulate and productive will survive. Digital collections are proliferating, but most remain difficult to use, and digital scholarship remains a backwater in most humanities departments with respect to hiring, promotion, and teaching practices. Only the scholars themselves are in a position to move the field forward. Experiences of the sciences in their initiatives for cyberinfrastructure and eScience offer valuable lessons. Information- and data-intensive, distributed, collaborative, and multi-disciplinary research is now the norm in the sciences, while remaining experimental in the humanities. Discussed here are six factors for comparison, selected for their implications for the future of digital scholarship in the humanities: publication practices, data, research methods, collaboration, incentives, and learning. Drawing upon lessons gleaned from these comparisons, humanities scholars are âcalled to actionâ with five questions to address as a community: What are data? What are the infrastructure requirements? Where are the social studies of digital humanities? What is the humanities laboratory of the 21st century? What is the value proposition for digital humanities in an era of declining budgets?

                [en]
            Many âendsâ of editing in the digital world may be distinguished. One may speak
               of âendâ as in the supersession of one model of editing (the
                  âintentionalist,â
               âdefinitive-textâ model) by another (the multiple texts, multiply-intentioned
               views enabled by digital methods). One may speak of âendâ as in aim: not only
               the aim of the author or authors, but also the aims of the editor or editors. These
               questions were already complicated in the print world; the advent of digital methods
               has both focussed and widened the contests around these concepts. The essay reviews
               some of these questions, with examples drawn from (inter alia) the utterances of the
               two George Bushes, from editions with which the author is associated of Chaucer,
               Dante, and of Armenian texts, from the eColi genome, and from Barack Obama's
               discussion of different viewpoints on the Constitution of the United States. The
               essay concludes that a huge shift is indeed underway in the editing world, towards a
               more open and participatory model of editing and reading.

            After centuries of image deprivation, we now bathe in a sea of pictures, most of them
    digitized at some stage. In the 1990s, as humanists began to sense the advantages of networked
    computing on the web, they conceived major new editorial projects that would depend to an
    extraordinary degree upon the documentary power of pictures. Despite evident progress in
    devising sturdy and responsive standards, images, and tools, stubborn problems persist in several key areas that are explored here through an overview of issues that arise as the William Blake Archive acquires images, prepares them for reproduction, and makes them available for manipulation by its users. Editing electronic images in so unsettled and unsettling an environment generates the provisional success â weak success â that is utterly characteristic of X-editing, electronic scholarly editing in our time.  Our dependence on current technology and the expertise of others is not a remediable condition. We must play the game as it presents itself, making the compromises that are necessary, and move ahead.

        This article presents the results of a semester-long project designed to determine how
          effectively interactive Web 2.0 technology can facilitate collaborative research in
          undergraduate learners. The study was conducted during a 2007 advanced Shakespeare course
          at the University of Central Florida that focused heavily on a new historicist approach to
          studying literature. In this paper we first establish the theoretical foundation for this
          particular approach to literary studies, then discuss more in-depth how the collaborative,
          inter-connective nature of wikis allowed students to witness first-hand some of the
          concealed assumptions enmeshed in the creation of historical explanation or narrative. We
          also discuss how, in thinking about the past, this technology allowed our students realize
          some of the stakes in describing history for the present. In other words, having students
          create wikis based on the social identities that recur in Shakespeareâs works developed an
          implicit awareness of motives for âdoingâ history. We also show how employing open
          source technology in a localized classroom setting can assuage some of the gaps we
          experience in trying to provide enough period coverage while also attending to theoretical
          apparatus and studentsâ experience of meaningful connections to material. On a larger
          scale, creating inquiry-based projects can alleviate some of the humanitiesâ disengagement
          from the âreal worldâ that many have been suggesting of late.

            The past decade has seen XML widely adopted within a variety of communities,

               libraries. The reasons for this are not primarily technical in origin, but social,
               and relate to the cultures of XML's designers and XML language implementors, and a
               failure on the part of the digital library community to grapple with the
               sociotechnical nature of XML and its implementation. Possible strategies for
               addressing these issues of interoperability might include reduction of the
               flexibility afforded by specific XML-based markup languages used by the digital
               library community, and an increased focus on standardizing translations between
               various communities of practice use of such markup languages.

The avatar is typically described as our second self in the virtual world of the game. The paper challenges this theory, suggesting that the avatar is better understood as a set of possible interactions, and proposes a second concept, the avatari. If the avatar is our second self, the avatari is the rebellious figure on the screen that we cannot quite control, and that jumps into the pit, gets hit by the enemy, or otherwise fails despite our best efforts to succeed. Conceptualizing video games in terms of the avatar and avatari enables thinking about video games via a more sophisticated and productive model of interactivity than many of the existing paradigms.

               applying data mining and information visualization tools to the task of hypothesis
               formulation. The trained droplets provide several functions. Their primary purpose is
               to encapsulate the results of the software training phase. They can be saved for
               future re-use against other collections or combinations of collections. They can be
               modified by having the user accept or reject features identified by the data mining
               software. Finally, they can also contain choices for how to display and organize
               items in the collection. The opportunity to develop a new interface object presents
               the designer with the challenge of effectively communicating what the tool is good

There are no once-and-done, permanent solutions.

            Since the early 1990s, theorizing in the digital humanities has often celebrated
               open-endedness and incompletion as inherent qualities of digital work. But a
               scholarly publisher undertaking preparation and sale of digital objects cannot
               altogether dispense with traditional notions of deadlines and completion if those
               publications are to enter the dual marketplaces of peer review and institutional
               purchase. The Electronic Imprint of the University of Virginia Press was funded in
               2001 with the goal of bringing born-digital scholarly projects under the aegis of the
               same review and marketing system that applies to books. In this article I describe
               how we defined the criteria for âdone-nessâ in creating two very different
               projects, a born-digital edition of Herman Melvilleâs Typee manuscript and a conversion of the letterpress Papers of George Washington into a digital edition. Our experience
               suggests that it is possible to categorize different genres of digital creations
               based on the extent to which intrinsic criteria for âdone-nessâ can be applied to
               them, and that decisions about completeness are always subject to extrinsic factors
               as well, such as budgetary constraints and the pressures created by competition and
               the evolution of standards.

            The case of the Orlando Project offers a useful interrogation of concepts like
               completion and finality, as they emerge in the arena of electronic publication. The
               idea of âdonenessâ circulates discursively within a complex and evolving
               scholarly ecology where new modes of digital publication are changing our conceptions
               of textuality, at the same time that models of publication, funding, and archiving
               are rapidly changing. Within this ecology, it is instrumental and indeed valuable to
               consider particular tasks and stages done, even as the capacities of digital media
               push against a sense of finality. However, careful interrogation of aims and ends is
               required to think through the relation of a digital project to completion, whether
               modular, provisional, or of the project as a whole.

                [en]
            In this study, a corpus of 300 male-authored and 300 female-authored French literary and historical texts is classified for author gender using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) implementation SVMLight, achieving up to 90% classification accuracy. The sets of words that were most useful in distinguishing male and female writing are extracted from the support vectors. The results reinforce previous findings from statistical analyses of the same corpus, and exhibit remarkable cross-linguistic parallels with the results garnered from SVM models trained in gender classification on selections from the British National Corpus. It is found that female authors use personal pronouns and negative polarity items at a much higher rate than their male counterparts, and male authors demonstrate a strong preference for determiners and numerical quantifiers. Among the words that characterize male or female writing consistently over the time period spanned by the corpus, a number of cohesive semantic groups are identified. Male authors, for example, use religious terminology rooted in the church, while female authors use secular language to discuss spirituality. Such differences would take an enormous human effort to discover by a close reading of such a large corpus, but once identified through text mining, they frame intriguing questions which scholars may address using traditional critical analysis methods.

                [en]
            Machine learning and text mining offer new models for text analysis in the humanities by
    searching for meaningful patterns across many hundreds or thousands of documents. In this study,
    we apply comparative text mining to a large database of 20th century Black Drama in an effort to
    examine linguistic distinctiveness of gender, race, and nationality. We first run tests on the
    plays of American versus non-American playwrights using a variety of learning techniques to
    classify these works, identifying those which are incorrectly classified and the features which
    distinguish the plays. We achieve a significant degree of performance in this
    cross-classification task and find features that may provide interpretative insights. Turning
    our attention to the question of gendered writing, we classify plays by male and female authors
    as well as the male and female characters depicted in these works. We again achieve significant
    results which provide a variety of feature lists clearly distinguishing the lexical choices made
    by male and female playwrights. While classification tasks such as these are successful and may
    be illuminating, they also raise several critical issues. The most successful classifications
    for author and character genders were accomplished by normalizing the data in various ways.
    Doing so creates a kind of distance from the text as originally composed, which may limit the
    interpretive utility of classification tools. By framing the classification tasks as binary
    oppositions (male/female, etc), the possibility arises of stereotypical or âlowest common
     denominatorâ results which may gloss over important critical elements, and may also
    reflect the experimental design. Text mining opens new avenues of textual and literary research
    by looking for patterns in large collections of documents, but should be employed with close
    attention to its methodological and critical limitations.

            The EncyclopÃ©die of Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond
               d'Alembert was one of the most important and revolutionary intellectual products of
               the French Enlightenment. Mobilizing many of the great â and the not-so-great â
                  philosophes of the 18th century, the EncyclopÃ©die was a massive reference work for the arts and
               sciences, which sought to organize and transmit the totality of human knowledge while
               at the same time serving as a vehicle for critical thinking. In its digital form, it
               is a highly structured corpus; some 55,000 of its 77,000 articles were labeled with
               classes of knowledge by the editors making it a perfect sandbox for experiments with
               supervised learning algorithms. In this study, we train a Naive Bayesian classifier
               on the labeled articles and use this model to determine class membership for the
               remaining articles. This model is then used to make binary comparisons between
               labeled texts from different classes in an effort to extract the most important
               features in terms of class distinction. Re-applying the model onto the original
               classified articles leads us to question our previous assumptions about the
               consistency and coherency of the ontology developed by the Encyclopedists. Finally,
               by applying this model to another corpus from 18th century France, the Journal de TrÃ©voux, or MÃ©moires pour l'Histoire des Sciences &
                  des Beaux-Arts, new light is shed on the domain of Literature as it was

            The nature of the academic lecture has changed with the introduction of wi-fi and
               cellular technologies. Interacting with personal screens during a lecture or other
               live event has become commonplace and, as a result, the economy of attention that
               defines these situations has changed. Is it possible to pay attention
               when sending a text message or surfing the web? For that matter, does
                  distraction always detract from the learning that takes place in
               these environments? In this article, we ask questions concerning the texture and
               shape of this emerging economy of attention. We do not take a position on the
               efficiency of new technologies for delivering educational content or their efficacy
               of competing for usersâ time and attention. Instead, we argue that the emerging
               social media provide new methods for choreographing attention in line with the
               performative conventions of any given situation. Rather than banning laptops and
               phones from the lecture hall and the classroom, we aim to ask what precisely they
               have on offer for these settings understood as performative sites, as well as for a
               culture that equates individual attentional behavior with intellectual and moral

					relations of causality between events and it ought to express the varieties
					of scholarly opinion about the attributes of events. By encoding the Heml
					data in the Resource Description Framework (RDF) it is possible to
					undertake these improvements. Moreover, an RDF-encoded Heml process
					provides easier access to CIDOC-CRM data into Heml events. Finally, a

            Incunabula, or books printed before 1500, are extremely difficult and expensive to
               convert to digital form. The primary challenges arise from the use of non-standard
               typographical glyphs based on medieval handwriting to abbreviate words. Further
               difficulties are also posed by the practice of inconsistently marking word breaks at
               the end of lines and reducing or even eliminating spacing between some words. As
               such, these documents form a distinct genre of electronic document that poses unique
               challenges for conversion to digital form. From 2005â2007, the Preservation and
               Access Research and Development Program at the National Endowment for the Humanities
               funded a study to explore methods for digitizing these difficult texts. This paper
               describes some of the results of that project. The work described in this paper
                  was completed by the âApproaching the Problems of Digitizing

               oral performance tradition that created the poems. We demonstrate how such a digital

               editions in print and suggest how a digital criticism might open new avenues for the

               we discuss what our project has in common with other digital editions of literary
               works, but how the oral, traditional nature of the poetry creates special

      Epigraphy as a discipline has evolved greatly over the centuries. Many
      epigraphists in the last 20 years have been investigating how to use
      digital technology to advance their research, but until the present
      decade, these undertakings were restrained by aspects of the
      technology. The late 1990s will be seen as a watershed moment in the
      transition from print-based to born-digital epigraphic publication. At
      present, the majority of new editions are still published solely in
      print, but by 2017 we believe this circumstance will change
      drastically. The history of epigraphy makes it quite clear that such
      transitions are natural to the discipline.

                [en]
            We describe two different strategies for generating the morphology of Latin verbs. First, we hand-code default inheritance hierarchies in the KATR formalism, treating inflectional exponents as markings associated with the application of rules by which complex word 
          forms are deduced from simpler roots or stems. The high degree of similarity among verbs of different conjugation classes allows us to formulate general rules; these general rules are, however, sometimes overridden by conjugation-specific rules. This approach allows linguists to gain an appreciation for the structure of verbs, gives teachers a foundation for organizing lessons in morphology, and provides students a technique for generating forms of any verb. Second, we start with a paradigm chart, then automatically remove common parts and redundant morphosyntactic property sets (columns), combine similar conjugations (rows), and generate the KATR theory that produces a complete table of forms for a set of lexemes. This second approach automatically determines principal parts (for Latin, we verify that there are four), groups inflection classes into super-classes, and builds full paradigm charts.

                [en]
            Art historically relevant visual knowledge can be deconstructed and the resulting
               components of this visual knowledge â visual discernments â lend themselves to be
               socially negotiated. Individual visual experts (like connoisseurs) do not share some
               grand and undividable cognitive cataloguing system; they are attentive to piecemeal
               visual discernments and the patterns in which these occur in reality. In conventional
               scholarly communication sophisticated tools to discuss perceptual patterns are
               lacking. This paper not only proposes a theoretical model of visual knowledge
               accumulation, but also describes a practical implementation, Art.Similarities, which is designed as a prototype of such a
               sophisticated tool. Using a custom-made interface it records visual behavior: the
               non-verbally expressed visual similarity judgments of distributed individuals. Users
               can be assigned to groups according to the qualities of their judgments. These
               qualities may be distilled from emerging similarity patterns. The implications of
               individual judgments in different user groups may vary considerably. Emerging
               patterns can be assessed both according to human analysis and statistical procedures.
               Most studies on art evaluation are attentive to either the characteristics of works,
               or the characteristics of observers. In this study both are considered as
               interdependent entities consistently.

                [en]
            Because so little primary historical work has been done on the classic text computer
				game âColossal Cave Adventureâ, academic and popular
				references to it frequently perpetuate inaccuracies. âAdventureâ was the first in a series of text-based games
					(âinteractive fictionâ) that emphasize exploring, puzzles, and
				story, typically in a fantasy setting; these games had a significant cultural impact
				in the late 1970s and a significant commercial presence in the early 1980s. Will
				Crowther based his program on a real cave in Kentucky; Don Woods expanded this
				version significantly. The expanded work has been examined as an occasion for
				narrative encounters  and as an aesthetic masterpiece of
				logic and utility ; however, previous attempts to assess
				the significance of âAdventureâ remain incomplete without
				access to Crowther's original source code and Crowther's original source cave.
				Accordingly, this paper analyzes previously unpublished files recovered from a
				backup of Woods's student account at Stanford, and documents an excursion to the
				real Colossal Cave in Kentucky in 2005. In addition, new interviews with Crowther,
				Woods, and their associates (particularly members of Crowther's family) provide new
				insights on the precise nature of Woods's significant contributions. Real locations
				in the cave and several artifacts (such as an iron rod and an axe head) correspond
				to their representation in Crowther's version; however, by May of 1977, Woods had
				expanded the game to include numerous locations that he invented, along with
				significant technical innovations (such as scorekeeping and a player inventory).
				Sources that incorrectly date Crowther's original to 1972 or 1974, or that identify
				it as a cartographic data file with no game or fantasy elements, are sourced thinly
				if at all. The new evidence establishes that Crowther wrote the game during the
				1975-76 academic year and probably abandoned it in early 1976. The original game
				employed magic, humor, simple combat, and basic puzzles, all of which Woods greatly
				expanded. While Crowther remained largely faithful to the geography of the real
				cave, his original did introduce subtle changes to the environment in order to
				improve the gameplay.

            Among the alternative kinds of narrative opened up by computer technology, one of
               earliest is interactive fiction (and specifically the âtext adventureâ or
                  âadventure gameâ), which first came into being in the 1970s. Text-based
               interactive fiction enjoyed a brief period of commercial success in the 1980s until
               it was overtaken by advances in computer graphics, but it continues to be read and
               written by enthusiastic amateurs. Although interactive fiction clearly has roots in
               computer gaming, it also has potential as a new form of literature.
            Since interactive fiction may be a medium unfamiliar to some readers, this article
               will start by defining it, explaining some of its conventions, and outlining its
               origins. It will then describe how one recent piece of interactive fiction, âAll Hope Abandonâ, explores aspects of Biblical Studies
               through the medium of IF, and will end by suggesting a number of fruitful links
               between interactive fiction and biblical text. In the course of the article several
               examples from âAll Hope Abandonâ will be given, and
               instructions on how to install and play the game will be provided at the end.

                [en]
            The close study of literary texts has a long and illustrious history. But the
               popularity of textual analysis has waned in recent decades, just at the time that
               widely available electronic texts were making traditional analytic tools easier to
               apply and encouraging the development of innovative computer-assisted tools. Without
               claiming any simple causal relationship, I argue that the marginalization of textual
               analysis and other text-centered approaches owes something to the dominance of
               Chomskyan linguistics and the popularity of high theory. Certainly both an
               introspective, sentence-oriented, formalist linguistic approach and literary theories
               deeply influenced by ideas about the sign's instability and the tendency of texts to
               disintegrate under critical pressure minimize the importance of the text. Using
               examples from Noam Chomsky, Jerome McGann, and Stanley Fish, I argue for a return to
               the text, specifically the electronic, computable text, to see what corpora,
               text-analysis, statistical stylistics, and authorship attribution can reveal about
               meanings and style. The recent resurgence of interest in scholarly editions, corpora,
               text- analysis, stylistics, and authorship suggest that the electronic text may
               finally reach its full potential.

                [en]
            In this paper, I extend theoretical understandings of the gaming activity and
               literary form called the âquestâ and its relationship to issues of
               interpretation, focusing primarily on game theory with concrete examples as well as
               some broadly applicable pedagogical uses of these ideas in literature classrooms. The
               argument contributes to a recent theoretical and practical discussion of
                  âquestsâ by scholars of games studies such as Aarseth 2004, Juul 2005, Tosca 2003, and Tronstad
                  2001. I build upon and revise these theoristsâ understandings by approaching
               a âquestâ as a goal-oriented activity in which players undertake a journey in search
               of meaning. By demonstrating similarities between the literary traditions in which
               quests are central and the practice of digital game design, I argue that quests can
               be better understood theoretically and more productively used in the classroom if
               meaning and action are regarded as complementary design principles instead of
               conflicting impulses. A revised understanding of quests can help to mediate between
               games and narratives by showing strategies by which game designers have created
               meaningful action, often in ways that are either unconsciously similar to or inspired
               by the literary traditions of mythology, epic, and romance. Specifically, game
               designers can use level design to create labyrinthine spaces that encode thematic
               implications, in the tradition of literary allegory. If these symbolic spaces are
               coordinated with significant obstacles and challenges, the apparent conflict between
               meaning and action can be resolved through engaging gameplay that allows players to
               enact a range of thematic ideas, contributing to the ongoing replay value of a
               digital game. I also suggest ways in which this understanding of quests can allow
               literature teachers to plan assignments where students transform literary narratives
               into interpretative quests taking the form of digital games. As a paradigmatic
               example, I describe one such assignment, in which my students adapted episodes from
               Pynchonâs The Crying of Lot 49 into design documents and
               prototypes, and I suggest some theoretical implications of its results for other
               instructors. By adapting works of literature into quests, students learn to discover
               and create meaning through the active exertion of cognitive and imaginative effort
               rather than absorbing it passively.

               Technology, and the Democratization of History","Abstract
                [en]
            Lincoln/Net (http://lincoln.lib.niu.edu), a product of the Abraham Lincoln Historical
               Digitization Project at Northern Illinois University Libraries, represents a new type
               of historically oriented digital library resource. Like many other digital libraries,
               it contains a large amount of searchable primary source materials. Like a number of
               other historically oriented online resources, project staff have organized
               Lincoln/Net around a specific topic, in this case Abraham Lincolnâs life and times in
               antebellum Illinois. In addition to Lincolnâs own papers, the projectâs databases
               contain resources shedding light on his context, including letters, diaries, and
               publications prepared by his peers. Unlike most historically oriented digital
               libraries however, the project Web site also includes a wealth of multimedia
               materials, including image, sound, video, and interactive map resources. But
               Lincoln/Net is perhaps most unique in that it furnishes its users with an extensive
               set of interpretive materials. This approach suggests that historians may play an
               expanding role in the development of digital libraries. It can also provide them with
               a badly-needed means of communicating with an audience beyond their own scholarly
               community and students. This communication can facilitate what one digital history
               pioneer has described as the âdemocratization
                  of history,â as defined by an expanded user group enjoying primary source
               materials and using them to engage in historical thinking .

                [en]
            For over a thousand years, Tibet has preserved and translated ancient Buddhist Sutras
               from India, keeping the tradition of Buddhist philosophy and meditation alive long
               after it died out in India by the 12th Century. Recent efforts to digitize materials
               from this textual tradition offer opportunities to broaden the circulation of rare
               materials to the exiled Tibetan scholarly community, but also suggest conceptual
               challenges arising from the complexity of the texts and their inherently multimodal
               character. This paper describes the scholarly and meditative traditions from which
               these texts come, and discusses possible approaches to their digitization.

                [en]
				Recent efforts to reconceptualize text analysis with computers in order to
					broaden the appeal of humanities computing have invoked the example of the
					Oulipo. Although there are similarities between the activities of the
					Oulipo and the new approach to computer-assisted literary analysis, the
					development of tools for the express purpose of encouraging scholars to
					play with texts does not follow the model of Oulipian research into
					potentialities. For the Oulipo, potential text analysis is less a question
					of interpreting literature than of supplying algorithms for the good use
					one can make of reading. Producing exemplary interpretations with
					algorithms is a secondary consideration. Oulipian constraints are better
					understood as toys with no intended purpose rather than as tools we use
					with some objective in mind. The procedures for making sense of texts
					provide for their own interpretation: they are not only instruments for
					discovering meaning but also reflections on making meaning.
